                                    <p>Albert Einstein, (born March 14, 1879, Ulm, Württemberg, Germany—died April 18,
                                        1955, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.), German-born physicist who developed the
                                        special and general theories of relativity and won the Nobel
                                        Prize for Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.
                                        Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th

                                                <p>Einstein’s parents were secular, middle-class Jews. His father, Hermann Einstein, was originally a
                                                    featherbed salesman and later ran an electrochemical factory with moderate success. His mother, the
                                                    former
                                                    Pauline Koch, ran the family household. He had one sister, Maria (who went by the name Maja), born
                                                    two years after Albert.</p>

                                                <p>Einstein would write that two “wonders” deeply affected his early years. The first was his encounter
                                                    with a compass at age five. He was mystified that invisible forces could deflect the needle. This
                                                    would
                                                    lead to a lifelong fascination with invisible forces. The second wonder came at age 12 when he
                                                    discovered a book of geometry, which he devoured, calling it his “sacred little geometry book.”</p>

                                                <p>Einstein became deeply religious at age 12, even composing several songs in praise of God and
                                                    chanting religious songs on the way to school. This began to change, however, after he read science
                                                    books that
                                                    contradicted his religious beliefs. This challenge to established authority left a deep and lasting
                                                    impression. At the Luitpold Gymnasium, Einstein often felt out of place and victimized by a
                                                    Prussian-style
                                                    educational system that seemed to stifle originality and creativity. One teacher even told him that
                                                    he would never amount to anything.</p>
                                                <p>Yet another important influence on Einstein was a young medical student, Max Talmud (later Max
                                                    Talmey), who often had dinner at the Einstein home. Talmud became an informal tutor, introducing
                                                    Einstein to
                                                    higher mathematics and philosophy. A pivotal turning point occurred when Einstein was 16. Talmud had
                                                    earlier introduced him to a children’s science series by Aaron Bernstein, Naturwissenschaftliche
                                                    Volksbucher
                                                    (1867–68; Popular Books on Physical Science), in which the author imagined riding alongside
                                                    electricity that was traveling inside a telegraph wire. Einstein then asked himself the question
                                                    that would
                                                    dominate his thinking for the next 10 years: What would a light beam look like if you could run
                                                    alongside it? If light were a wave, then the light beam should appear stationary, like a frozen
                                                    wave. Even
                                                    as a child, though, he knew that stationary light waves had never been seen, so there was a paradox.
                                                    Einstein also wrote his first “scientific paper” at that time (“The Investigation of the State of
                                                    Aether in Magnetic Fields”).
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Einstein’s education was disrupted by his father’s repeated failures at business. In 1894, after his
                                                    company failed to get an important contract to electrify the city of Munich, Hermann Einstein moved
                                                    to
                                                    Milan to work with a relative. Einstein was left at a boardinghouse in Munich and expected to finish
                                                    his education. Alone, miserable, and repelled by the looming prospect of military duty when he
                                                    turned
                                                    16, Einstein ran away six months later and landed on the doorstep of his surprised parents. His
                                                    parents realized the enormous problems that he faced as a school dropout and draft dodger with no
                                                    employable
                                                    skills. His prospects did not look promising.</p>

                                                <p>Fortunately, Einstein could apply directly to the Eidgenössische Polytechnische Schule (“Swiss
                                                    Federal Polytechnic School”; in 1911, following expansion in 1909 to full university status, it was
                                                    renamed
                                                    the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, or “Swiss Federal Institute of Technology”) in Zürich

                                                    showed that he excelled in mathematics and physics, but he failed at French, chemistry, and biology.
                                                    Because of his exceptional math scores, he was allowed into the polytechnic on the condition that
                                                    he first finish his formal schooling. He went to a special high school run by Jost Winteler in
                                                    Aarau, Switzerland, and graduated in 1896. He also renounced his German citizenship at that time.
                                                    (He was
                                                    stateless until 1901, when he was granted Swiss citizenship.) He became lifelong friends with the
                                                    Winteler family, with whom he had been boarding. (Winteler’s daughter, Marie, was Einstein’s first
                                                    love;
                                                    Einstein’s sister, Maja, would eventually marry Winteler’s son Paul; and his close friend Michele
                                                    Besso would marry their eldest daughter, Anna.)</p>

                                                <p>Einstein would recall that his years in Zürich were some of the happiest years of his life. He met
                                                    many students who would become loyal friends, such as Marcel Grossmann, a mathematician, and Besso,
                                                    with
                                                    whom he enjoyed lengthy conversations about space and time. He also met his future wife, Mileva
                                                    Maric, a fellow physics student from Serbia.</p>

                                                <p>After graduation in 1900, Einstein faced one of the greatest crises in his life. Because he studied
                                                    advanced subjects on his own, he often cut classes; this earned him the animosity of some
                                                    professors, especially
                                                    Heinrich Weber. Unfortunately, Einstein asked Weber for a letter of recommendation. Einstein was
                                                    subsequently turned down for every academic position that he applied to.</p>
                                                <p>Meanwhile, Einstein’s relationship with Maric deepened, but his parents vehemently opposed the
                                                    relationship. His mother especially objected to her Serbian background (Maric’s family was Eastern
                                                    Orthodox
                                                    Christian). Einstein defied his parents, however, and in January 1902 he and Maric even had a child,
                                                    Lieserl, whose fate is unknown. (It is commonly thought that she died of scarlet fever or was given
                                                    up for adoption.)
                                                </p>

                                                <p>In 1902 Einstein reached perhaps the lowest point in his life. He could not marry Maric and support a
                                                    family without a job, and his father’s business went bankrupt. Desperate and unemployed, Einstein
                                                    took
                                                    lowly jobs tutoring children, but he was fired from even these jobs.</p>

                                                <p>The turning point came later that year, when the father of his lifelong friend Marcel Grossmann was
                                                    able to recommend him for a position as a clerk in the Swiss patent office in Bern. About then,
                                                    Einstein’s
                                                    father became seriously ill and, just before he died, gave his blessing for his son to marry Maric.
                                                    For years, Einstein would experience enormous sadness remembering that his father had died thinking
                                                    him a failure.</p>

                                                <p>With a small but steady income for the first time, Einstein felt confident enough to marry Maric,
                                                    which he did on January 6, 1903. Their children, Hans Albert and Eduard, were born in Bern in 1904
                                                    and 1910,
                                                    respectively. In hindsight, Einstein’s job at the patent office was a blessing. He would quickly
                                                    finish analyzing patent applications, leaving him time to daydream about the vision that had
                                                    obsessed
                                                    him since he was 16: What would happen if you raced alongside a light beam? While at the polytechnic
                                                    school he had studied Maxwell’s equations, which describe the nature of light, and discovered a fact
                                                    unknown to James Clerk Maxwell himself—namely, that the speed of light remains the same no matter
                                                    how fast one moves. This violates Newton’s laws of motion, however, because there is no absolute
                                                    velocity
                                                    in Isaac Newton’s theory. This insight led Einstein to formulate the principle of relativity: “the
                                                    speed of light is a constant in any inertial frame (constantly moving frame).”

                                                <p>During 1905, often called Einstein’s “miracle year,” he published four papers in the Annalen der
                                                    Physik, each of which would alter the course of modern physics:

                                                <p>Other scientists, especially Henri Poincaré and Hendrik Lorentz, had pieces of the theory of special
                                                    relativity, but Einstein was the first to assemble the whole theory together and to realize that it
                                                    was
                                                    a universal law of nature, not a curious figment of motion in the ether, as Poincaré and Lorentz had
                                                    thought. (In one private letter to Mileva, Einstein referred to “our theory,” which has led some to
                                                    speculate that she was a cofounder of relativity theory. However, Mileva had abandoned physics after
                                                    twice failing her graduate exams, and there is no record of her involvement in developing
                                                    relativity.
                                                    In fact, in his 1905 paper, Einstein only credits his conversations with Besso in developing
                                                    relativity.)

                                                    of light. Einstein was alone in realizing that they were in contradiction and that one of them must

                                                <p>At first Einstein’s 1905 papers were ignored by the physics community. This began to change after he
                                                    received the attention of just one physicist, perhaps the most influential physicist of his
                                                    generation,
                                                    Max Planck, the founder of the quantum theory.</p>
                                                <p>Soon, owing to Planck’s laudatory comments and to experiments that gradually confirmed his theories,
                                                    Einstein was invited to lecture at international meetings, such as the Solvay Conferences, and he
                                                    rose
                                                    rapidly in the academic world. He was offered a series of positions at increasingly prestigious
                                                    institutions, including the University of Zürich, the University of Prague, the Swiss Federal
                                                    Institute
                                                    of Technology, and finally the University of Berlin, where he served as director of the Kaiser
                                                    Wilhelm Institute for Physics from 1913 to 1933 (although the opening of the institute was delayed
                                                    until
                                                    1917).

                                                <p>Even as his fame spread, Einstein’s marriage was falling apart. He was constantly on the road,
                                                    speaking at international conferences, and lost in contemplation of relativity. The couple argued
                                                    frequently
                                                    about their children and their meager finances. Convinced that his marriage was doomed, Einstein
                                                    began an affair with a cousin, Elsa Löwenthal, whom he later married. (Elsa was a first cousin on
                                                    his
                                                    mother’s side and a second cousin on his father’s side.) When he finally divorced Mileva in 1919, he
                                                    agreed to give her the money he might receive if he ever won a Nobel Prize.</p>

                                                <p>One of the deep thoughts that consumed Einstein from 1905 to 1915 was a crucial flaw in his own
                                                    theory: it made no mention of gravitation or acceleration. His friend Paul Ehrenfest had noticed a
                                                    curious
                                                    fact. If a disk is spinning, its rim travels faster than its centre, and hence (by special
                                                    relativity) metre sticks placed on its circumference should shrink. This meant that Euclidean plane
                                                    geometry
                                                    must fail for the disk. For the next 10 years, Einstein would be absorbed with formulating a theory
                                                    of gravity in terms of the curvature of space-time. To Einstein, Newton’s gravitational force was
                                                    actually
                                                    a by-product of a deeper reality: the bending of the fabric of space and time.</p>

                                                <p>In November 1915 Einstein finally completed the general theory of relativity, which he considered to
                                                    be his masterpiece. In the summer of 1915, Einstein had given six two-hour lectures at the
                                                    University
                                                    of Göttingen that thoroughly explained an incomplete version of general relativity that lacked a few
                                                    necessary mathematical details. Much to Einstein’s consternation, the mathematician David Hilbert,
                                                    who had organized the lectures at his university and had been corresponding with Einstein, then
                                                    completed these details and submitted a paper in November on general relativity just five days
                                                    before Einstein,
                                                    as if the theory were his own. Later they patched up their differences and remained friends.
                                                    Einstein would write to Hilbert,
                                                    <blockquote><em><q>I struggled against a resulting sense of bitterness,
                                                                and I did so with complete success. I once more think of you
                                                                in unclouded friendship, and would ask you to try to do
                                                                likewise toward me.</q></em></blockquote>
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Today physicists refer to the action from which the equations are derived as the Einstein-Hilbert
                                                    action, but the theory itself is attributed solely to Einstein.</p>

                                                <p>Einstein was convinced that general relativity was correct because of its mathematical beauty and
                                                    because it accurately predicted the precession of the perihelion of Mercury’s orbit around the Sun
                                                    (see Mercury:
                                                    Mercury in tests of relativity). His theory also predicted a measurable deflection of light around
                                                    the Sun. As a consequence, he even offered to help fund an expedition to measure the deflection of
                                                    starlight
                                                    during an eclipse of the Sun.</p>

                                                <p>Einstein’s work was interrupted by World War I. A lifelong pacifist, he was only one of four
                                                    intellectuals in Germany to sign a manifesto opposing Germany’s entry into war. Disgusted, he called
                                                    nationalism
                                                    “the measles of mankind.” He would write, “At such a time as this, one realizes what a sorry species
                                                    of animal one belongs to.” </p>
                                                <p>In the chaos unleashed after the war, in November 1918, radical students seized control of the
                                                    University of Berlin and held the rector of the college and several professors hostage. Many feared
                                                    that calling
                                                    in the police to release the officials would result in a tragic confrontation. Einstein, because he
                                                    was respected by both students and faculty, was the logical candidate to mediate this crisis.
                                                    Together
                                                    with Max Born, Einstein brokered a compromise that resolved it. </p>
                                                <p>After the war, two expeditions were sent to test Einstein’s prediction of deflected starlight near
                                                    the Sun. One set sail for the island of Principe, off the coast of West Africa, and the other to

                                                    were announced in London at a joint meeting of the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society.

                                                <p>The headline of The Times of London read, “Revolution in Science—New Theory of the Universe—Newton’s

                                                    world-renowned
                                                    physicist, the successor to Isaac Newton.</p>

                                                <p>Invitations came pouring in for him to speak around the world. In 1921 Einstein began the first of
                                                    several world tours, visiting the United States, England, Japan, and France. Everywhere he went, the
                                                    crowds
                                                    numbered in the thousands. En route from Japan, he received word that he had received the Nobel
                                                    Prize for Physics, but for the photoelectric effect rather than for his relativity theories. During

                                                    acceptance speech, Einstein startled the audience by speaking about relativity instead of the
                                                    photoelectric effect.</p>
                                                <p>Einstein also launched the new science of cosmology. His equations predicted that the universe is
                                                    dynamic—expanding or contracting. This contradicted the prevailing view that the universe was
                                                    static, so
                                                    he reluctantly introduced a “cosmological term” to stabilize his model of the universe. In 1929
                                                    astronomer Edwin Hubble found that the universe was indeed expanding, thereby confirming Einstein’s
                                                    earlier
                                                    work. In 1930, in a visit to the Mount Wilson Observatory near Los Angeles, Einstein met with Hubble
                                                    and declared the cosmological constant to be his “greatest blunder.” Recent satellite data, however,
                                                    have shown that the cosmological constant is probably not zero but actually dominates the
                                                    matter-energy content of the entire universe. Einstein’s “blunder” apparently determines the
                                                    ultimate fate of
                                                    the universe.</p>

                                                <p>During that same visit to California, Einstein was asked to appear alongside the comic actor Charlie
                                                    Chaplin during the Hollywood debut of the film City Lights. When they were mobbed by thousands,
                                                    Chaplin
                                                    remarked, “The people applaud me because everybody understands me, and they applaud you because no
                                                    one understands you.” Einstein asked Chaplin, “What does it all mean?” Chaplin replied, “Nothing.”
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Einstein also began correspondences with other influential thinkers during this period. He
                                                    corresponded with Sigmund Freud (both of them had sons with mental problems) on whether war was
                                                    intrinsic to humanity.
                                                    He discussed with the Indian mystic Rabindranath Tagore the question of whether consciousness can
                                                    affect existence. One journalist remarked,</p>

                                                    <blockquote><em>It was interesting to see them together—Tagore, the poet with the head of a thinker,
                                                            and Einstein, the thinker with the head of a poet. It seemed to an observer as though two
                                                            planets were engaged in a chat.</em></blockquote>

                                                <p>Einstein also clarified his religious views, stating that he believed there was an “old one” who was
                                                    the ultimate lawgiver. He wrote that he did not believe in a personal God that intervened in human
                                                    affairs
                                                    but instead believed in the God of the 17th-century Dutch Jewish philosopher Benedict de Spinoza—the
                                                    God of harmony and beauty. His task, he believed, was to formulate a master theory that would allow
                                                    him to “read the mind of God.” He would write,</p>

                                                <p>Inevitably, Einstein’s fame and the great success of his theories created a backlash. The rising Nazi
                                                    movement found a convenient target in relativity, branding it “Jewish physics” and sponsoring
                                                    conferences
                                                    and book burnings to denounce Einstein and his theories. The Nazis enlisted other physicists,
                                                    including Nobel laureates Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark, to denounce Einstein. One Hundred

                                                    Einstein was published in 1931. When asked to comment on this denunciation of relativity by so many
                                                    scientists, Einstein replied that to defeat relativity one did not need the word of 100 scientists,
                                                    just one fact.</p>

                                                <p>In December 1932 Einstein decided to leave Germany forever (he would never go back). It became
                                                    obvious to Einstein that his life was in danger. A Nazi organization published a magazine with
                                                    Einstein’s picture
                                                    and the caption “Not Yet Hanged” on the cover. There was even a price on his head. So great was the
                                                    threat that Einstein split with his pacifist friends and said that it was justified to defend
                                                    yourself
                                                    with arms against Nazi aggression. To Einstein, pacifism was not an absolute concept but one that
                                                    had to be re-examined depending on the magnitude of the threat.</p>

                                                <p>Einstein settled at the newly formed Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, New Jersey, which
                                                    soon became a mecca for physicists from around the world. Newspaper articles declared that the “pope
                                                    of physics”
                                                    had left Germany and that Princeton had become the new Vatican.</p>

                                                <p>The 1930s were hard years for Einstein. His son Eduard was diagnosed with schizophrenia and suffered
                                                    a mental breakdown in 1930. (Eduard would be institutionalized for the rest of his life.) Einstein’s

                                                    friend, physicist Paul Ehrenfest, who helped in the development of general relativity, committed
                                                    suicide in 1933. And Einstein’s beloved wife, Elsa, died in 1936.</p>
                                                <p>To his horror, during the late 1930s, physicists began seriously to consider whether his equation E =
                                                    mc2 might make an atomic bomb possible. In 1920 Einstein himself had considered but eventually
                                                    dismissed
                                                    the possibility. However, he left it open if a method could be found to magnify the power of the
                                                    atom. Then in 1938–39 Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassmann, Lise Meitner, and Otto Frisch showed that vast
                                                    amounts
                                                    of energy could be unleashed by the splitting of the uranium atom. The news electrified the physics
                                                    community.</p>

                                                <p>In July 1939 physicist Leo Szilard convinced Einstein that he should send a letter to U.S. President
                                                    Franklin D. Roosevelt urging him to develop an atomic bomb. With Einstein’s guidance, Szilard
                                                    drafted
                                                    a letter on August 2 that Einstein signed, and the document was delivered to Roosevelt by one of his
                                                    economic advisers, Alexander Sachs, on October 11. Roosevelt wrote back on October 19, informing
                                                    Einstein
                                                    that he had organized the Uranium Committee to study the issue.</p>

                                                <p>Einstein was granted permanent residency in the United States in 1935 and became an American citizen
                                                    in 1940, although he chose to retain his Swiss citizenship. During the war Einstein’s colleagues
                                                    were
                                                    asked to journey to the desert town of Los Alamos, New Mexico, to develop the first atomic bomb for
                                                    the Manhattan Project. Einstein, the man whose equation had set the whole effort into motion, was
                                                    never
                                                    asked to participate. Voluminous declassified Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) files, numbering
                                                    several thousand, reveal the reason: the U.S. government feared Einstein’s lifelong association with
                                                    peace and socialist organizations. (FBI director J. Edgar Hoover went so far as to recommend that
                                                    Einstein be kept out of America by the Alien Exclusion Act, but he was overruled by the U.S. State
                                                    Department.)
                                                    Instead, during the war Einstein was asked to help the U.S. Navy evaluate designs for future weapons
                                                    systems. Einstein also helped the war effort by auctioning off priceless personal manuscripts. In
                                                    particular, a handwritten copy of his 1905 paper on special relativity was sold for $6.5 million. It
                                                    is now located in the Library of Congress.</p>

                                                <p>Einstein was on vacation when he heard the news that an atomic bomb had been dropped on Japan. Almost
                                                    immediately he was part of an international effort to try to bring the atomic bomb under control,
                                                    forming
                                                    the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists.</p>

                                                <p>The physics community split on the question of whether to build a hydrogen bomb. J. Robert
                                                    Oppenheimer, the director of the atomic bomb project, was stripped of his security clearance for
                                                    having suspected
                                                    leftist associations. Einstein backed Oppenheimer and opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb,
                                                    instead calling for international controls on the spread of nuclear technology. Einstein also was
                                                    increasingly
                                                    drawn to antiwar activities and to advancing the civil rights of African Americans.</p>

                                                <p>In 1952 David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s premier, offered Einstein the post of president of Israel.
                                                    Einstein, a prominent figure in the Zionist movement, respectfully declined.</p>

                                                <p>Although Einstein continued to pioneer many key developments in the theory of general relativity—such
                                                    as wormholes, higher dimensions, the possibility of time travel, the existence of black holes, and

                                                    creation of the universe—he was increasingly isolated from the rest of the physics community.
                                                    Because of the huge strides made by quantum theory in unraveling the secrets of atoms and molecules,
                                                    the
                                                    majority of physicists were working on the quantum theory, not relativity. In fact, Einstein would
                                                    engage in a series of historic private debates with Niels Bohr, originator of the Bohr atomic model.
                                                    Through a series of sophisticated “thought experiments,” Einstein tried to find logical
                                                    inconsistencies in the quantum theory, particularly its lack of a deterministic mechanism. Einstein
                                                    would often
                                                    say that “God does not play dice with the universe.”</p>

                                                <p>In 1935 Einstein’s most celebrated attack on the quantum theory led to the EPR
                                                    (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) thought experiment. According to quantum theory, under certain
                                                    circumstances two electrons separated
                                                    by huge distances would have their properties linked, as if by an umbilical cord. Under these
                                                    circumstances, if the properties of the first electron were measured, the state of the second
                                                    electron would
                                                    be known instantly—faster than the speed of light. This conclusion, Einstein claimed, clearly
                                                    violated relativity. (Experiments conducted since then have confirmed that the quantum theory,
                                                    rather than
                                                    Einstein, was correct about the EPR experiment. In essence, what Einstein had actually shown was
                                                    that quantum mechanics is nonlocal; i.e., random information can travel faster than light. This does
                                                    not
                                                    violate relativity, because the information is random and therefore useless.)</p>

                                                <p>The other reason for Einstein’s increasing detachment from his colleagues was his obsession,
                                                    beginning in 1925, with discovering a unified field theory—an all-embracing theory that would unify
                                                    the forces
                                                    of the universe, and thereby the laws of physics, into one framework. In his later years he stopped
                                                    opposing the quantum theory and tried to incorporate it, along with light and gravity, into a larger
                                                    unified field theory. Gradually Einstein became set in his ways. He rarely traveled far and confined
                                                    himself to long walks around Princeton with close associates, whom he engaged in deep conversations
                                                    about politics, religion, physics, and his unified field theory. In 1950 he published an article on
                                                    his theory in Scientific American, but because it neglected the still-mysterious strong force, it
                                                    was
                                                    necessarily incomplete. When he died five years later of an aortic aneurysm, it was still
                                                    unfinished.</p>

                                                    strong force, a major piece of any unified field theory, was still a total mystery in Einstein’s
                                                    lifetime.
                                                    Only in the 1970s and ’80s did physicists begin to unravel the secret of the strong force with the
                                                    quark model. Nevertheless, Einstein’s work continues to win Nobel Prizes for succeeding physicists.
                                                    In 1993 a Nobel Prize was awarded to the discoverers of gravitation waves, predicted by Einstein. In
                                                    1995 a Nobel Prize was awarded to the discoverers of Bose-Einstein condensates (a new form of matter
                                                    that can occur at extremely low temperatures). Known black holes now number in the thousands. New
                                                    generations of space satellites have continued to verify the cosmology of Einstein. And many leading
                                                    physicists are trying to finish Einstein’s ultimate dream of a “theory of everything.”</p>

                                                <p> <strong>Early Years</strong> </p> 
                                                <p> Schrödinger was born in Erdberg [de], Vienna, Austria, on 12 August 1887, to Rudolf Schrödinger [de]
                                                (cerecloth producer, botanist) and Georgine Emilia Brenda Schrödinger (née Bauer) (daughter of
                                                Alexander Bauer [de],professor of chemistry, TU Wien). He was their only child.</p>
                                                <p>His mother was of half Austrian and half English descent; his father was Catholic and his mother was
                                                Lutheran. Although he was raised in a religious household as a Lutheran, he himself was an atheist.
                                                However, he had strong interests in Eastern religions and pantheism, and he used religious symbolism in
                                                his works. He also believed his scientific work was an approach to the godhead, albeit in a
                                                intellectual sense.</p> 
                                                <p>He was also able to learn English outside school, as his maternal grandmother was British. Between
                                                1906 and 1910 Schrödinger studied in Vienna under Franz S. Exner (1849–1926) and Friedrich Hasenöhrl
                                                (1874–1915). He also conducted experimental work with Karl Wilhelm Friedrich "Fritz" Kohlrausch.</p>
                                                <p>In 1911, Schrödinger became an assistant to Exner. At an early age, Schrödinger was strongly influenced
                                                by Arthur Schopenhauer. As a result of his extensive reading of Schopenhauer's works, he became deeply
                                                interested throughout his life in colour theory and philosophy. In his lecture "Mind and Matter", he
                                                said that "The world extended in space and time is but our representation." This is a repetition of the
                                                first words of Schopenhauer's main work.</p>

                                                <p> <strong>Middle Years</strong> </p>
                                                <p>Erwin Schrödinger as a young man
                                                In 1914 Erwin Schrödinger achieved Habilitation (venia legendi). Between 1914 and 1918 he participated
                                                in war work as a commissioned officer in the Austrian fortress artillery (Gorizia, Duino, Sistiana,
                                                Prosecco, Vienna). In 1920 he became the assistant to Max Wien, in Jena, and in September 1920 he
                                                attained the position of ao. Prof. (ausserordentlicher Professor), roughly equivalent to Reader (UK) or
                                                associate professor (US), in Stuttgart. In 1921, he became o. Prof. (ordentlicher Professor, i.e. full
                                                professor), in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland).</p>
                                                <p>In 1921, he moved to the University of Zürich. In 1927, he succeeded Max Planck at the Friedrich Wilhelm
                                                University in Berlin. In 1933, Schrödinger decided to leave Germany; he disliked the Nazis'
                                                antisemitism. He became a Fellow of Magdalen College at the University of Oxford. Soon after he arrived,
                                                he received the Nobel Prize together with Paul Dirac. His position at Oxford did not work out well; his
                                                unconventional domestic arrangements, sharing living quarters with two women, were not met with
                                                acceptance. In 1934, Schrödinger lectured at Princeton University; he was offered a permanent position
                                                there, but did not accept it. Again, his wish to set up house with his wife and his mistress may have
                                                created a problem. He had the prospect of a position at the University of Edinburgh but visa delays
                                                occurred, and in the end he took up a position at the University of Graz in Austria in 1936. He had also
                                                accepted the offer of chair position at Department of Physics, Allahabad University in India.</p>
                                                <p>In the midst of these tenure issues in 1935, after extensive correspondence with Albert Einstein, he
                                                proposed what is now called the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.</p>

                                                <p> <strong>Later Years</strong> </p>
                                                <p>In 1938, after the Anschluss, Schrödinger had problems because of his flight from Germany in 1933 and
                                                his known opposition to Nazism. He issued a statement recanting this opposition (he later regretted
                                                doing so and explained the reason to Einstein). However, this did not fully appease the new
                                                dispensation and the University of Graz dismissed him from his job for political unreliability. He
                                                suffered harassment and received instructions not to leave the country, but he and his wife fled to
                                                Italy. From there, he went to visiting positions in Oxford and Ghent University.</p>
                                                <p>In the same year he received a personal invitation from Ireland's Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera – a
                                                mathematician himself – to reside in Ireland and agree to help establish an Institute for Advanced
                                                Studies in Dublin. He moved to Clontarf, Dublin, became the Director of the School for Theoretical
                                                Physics in 1940 and remained there for 17 years. He became a naturalized Irish citizen in 1948, but
                                                retained his Austrian citizenship. He wrote around 50 further publications on various
                                                topics, including his explorations of unified field theory.</p>
                                                <p>In 1944, he wrote What Is Life?, which contains a discussion of negentropy and the concept of a complex
                                                molecule with the genetic code for living organisms. According to James D. Watson's memoir, DNA, the
                                                Secret of Life, Schrödinger's book gave Watson the inspiration to research the gene, which led to the
                                                discovery of the DNA double helix structure in 1953. Similarly, Francis Crick, in his autobiographical
                                                book What Mad Pursuit, described how he was influenced by Schrödinger's speculations about how genetic
                                                information might be stored in molecules.</p>
                                                <p>Schrödinger stayed in Dublin until retiring in 1955. He had a lifelong interest in the Vedanta
                                                philosophy of Hinduism, which influenced his speculations at the close of What Is Life? about the
                                                possibility that individual consciousness is only a manifestation of a unitary consciousness pervading
                                                the universe. A manuscript "Fragment from an unpublished dialogue of Galileo" from this time
                                                recently resurfaced at The King's Hospital boarding school, Dublin after it was written for the
                                                School's 1955 edition of their Blue Coat to celebrate his leaving of Dublin to take up his appointment
                                                as Chair of Physics at the University of Vienna.</p>
                                                <p>In 1956, he returned to Vienna (chair ad personam). At an important lecture during the World Energy
                                                Conference he refused to speak on nuclear energy because of his skepticism about it and gave a
                                                philosophical lecture instead. During this period Schrödinger turned from mainstream quantum mechanics'
                                                definition of wave–particle duality and promoted the wave idea alone, causing much
                                                controversy.</p>

                                                <p> <strong>Personal Life</strong> </p>
                                                <p>On 6 April 1920, Schrödinger married Annemarie (Anny) Bertel. Schrödinger suffered from tuberculosis
                                                and several times in the 1920s stayed at a sanatorium in Arosa. It was there that he formulated his wave equation. As has been noted above, Schrödinger had an unconventional personal life. When he migrated
                                                to Ireland in 1938, he obtained visas for himself, his wife and also another woman, Mrs. Hilde March.
                                                March was the wife of an Austrian colleague and Schrödinger had fathered a daughter with her in
                                                1934. Schrödinger wrote personally to the Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, to obtain the visa for Mrs.
                                                March. In October 1939 the ménage à trois duly took up residence in Dublin. Schrödinger fathered two further daughters by two different women during his time in Ireland.</p>
                                                <p>On 4 January 1961, Schrödinger died of tuberculosis, aged 73, in Vienna. He left Anny a widow, and
                                                was buried in Alpbach, Austria, in a Catholic cemetery. Although he was not Catholic, the priest in
                                                charge of the cemetery permitted the burial after learning Schrödinger was a member of the Pontifical
                                                Academy of Sciences. His wife, Anny (born 3 December 1896) died on 3 October 1965. Schrödinger's
                                                grandson, Professor Terry Rudolph, has followed in his footsteps as a quantum physicist, and teaches at
                                                Imperial College London.</p>

                                                <p> <strong>Early Career</strong> </p>
                                                <p>Early in his life, Schrödinger experimented in the fields of electrical engineering, atmospheric
                                                    electricity, and atmospheric radioactivity, but he usually worked with his former teacher Franz
                                                    Exner. He also studied vibrational theory, the theory of Brownian movement, and mathematical
                                                    statistics. In 1912, at the request of the editors of the Handbook of Electricity and Magnetism,
                                                    Schrödinger wrote an article titled Dieelectrism. That same year, Schrödinger gave a theoretical
                                                    estimate of the probable height distribution of radioactive substances, which is required to explain
                                                    the observed radioactivity of the atmosphere, and in August 1913 executed several experiments in
                                                    Zeehame that confirmed his theoretical estimate and those of Victor Franz Hess. For this work,
                                                    Schrödinger was awarded the 1920 Haitinger Prize (Haitinger-Preis) of the Austrian Academy of
                                                    Sciences. Other experimental studies conducted by the young researcher in 1914 were checking
                                                    formulas for capillary pressure in gas bubbles and the study of the properties of soft
                                                    beta-radiation appearing in the fall of gamma rays on the surface of metal. The last work he
                                                    performed together with his friend Fritz Kohlrausch. In 1919, Schrödinger performed his last
                                                    physical experiment on coherent light and subsequently focused on theoretical studies.</p>

                                                <p> <strong>Quantum Mechanics</strong> </p>
                                                <p><em>New Quantum Theory</em></p>
                                                <p>In the first years of his career Schrödinger became acquainted with the ideas of quantum theory,
                                                    developed in the works of Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Arnold Sommerfeld, and others.
                                                    This knowledge helped him work on some problems in theoretical physics, but the Austrian scientist
                                                    at the time was not yet ready to part with the traditional methods of classical physics.</p>
                                                <p>The first publications of Schrödinger about atomic theory and the theory of spectra began to emerge
                                                    only from the beginning of the 1920s, after his personal acquaintance with Sommerfeld and Wolfgang
                                                    Pauli and his move to Germany. In January 1921, Schrödinger finished his first article on this
                                                    subject, about the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld effect of the interaction of electrons on some
                                                    features of the spectra of the alkali metals. Of particular interest to him was the introduction of
                                                    relativistic considerations in quantum theory. In autumn 1922 he analyzed the electron orbits in an
                                                    atom from a geometric point of view, using methods developed by the mathematician Hermann Weyl
                                                    (1885–1955). This work, in which it was shown that quantum orbits are associated with certain
                                                    geometric properties, was an important step in predicting some of the features of wave mechanics.
                                                    Earlier in the same year he created the Schrödinger equation of the relativistic Doppler effect for
                                                    spectral lines, based on the hypothesis of light quanta and considerations of energy and momentum.
                                                    He liked the idea of his teacher Exner on the statistical nature of the conservation laws, so he
                                                    enthusiastically embraced the articles of Bohr, Kramers, and Slater, which suggested the possibility
                                                    of violation of these laws in individual atomic processes (for example, in the process of emission
                                                    of radiation). Although the experiments of Hans Geiger and Walther Bothe soon cast doubt on this,
                                                    the idea of energy as a statistical concept was a lifelong attraction for Schrödinger and he
                                                    discussed it in some reports and publications.</p>

                                                <p> <strong>Creation of Wave Mechanics</strong> </p>
                                                <p>In January of 1926, Schrödinger published in Annalen der Physik the paper "Quantisierung als
                                                    Eigenwertproblem" (Quantization as an Eigenvalue Problem) on wave mechanics and presented what is
                                                    now known as the Schrödinger equation. In this paper, he gave a "derivation" of the wave equation
                                                    for time-independent systems and showed that it gave the correct energy eigenvalues for a
                                                    hydrogen-like atom. This paper has been universally celebrated as one of the most important
                                                    achievements of the twentieth century and created a revolution in most areas of quantum mechanics
                                                    and indeed of all physics and chemistry. A second paper was submitted just four weeks later that
                                                    solved the quantum harmonic oscillator, rigid rotor, and diatomic molecule problems and gave a new
                                                    derivation of the Schrödinger equation. A third paper, published in May, showed the equivalence of
                                                    his approach to that of Heisenberg and gave the treatment of the Stark effect. A fourth paper in
                                                    this series showed how to treat problems in which the system changes with time, as in scattering
                                                    problems. In this paper he introduced a complex solution to the Wave equation in order to prevent
                                                    the occurrence of fourth and sixth order differential equations. (This was arguably the moment when
                                                    quantum mechanics switched from real to complex numbers.) When he introduced complex numbers in
                                                    order to lower the order of the differential equations, something magical happened, and all of wave
                                                    mechanics was at his feet. (He eventually reduced the order to one.) These papers were his central
                                                    achievement and were at once recognized as having great significance by the physics community.</p>

                                                <p>Schrödinger was not entirely comfortable with the implications of quantum theory. He wrote about the
                                                    probability interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying: "I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had
                                                    anything to do with it." (Just in order to ridicule the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
                                                    mechanics he contrived the famous thought-experiment called Schrödinger's cat paradox.)</p>


                                                <p> <strong>Work on a Unified Field Theory</strong> </p>
                                                Following his work on quantum mechanics, Schrödinger devoted considerable effort to working on a unified
                                                field theory that would unite gravity, electromagnetism, and nuclear forces within the basic framework
                                                of General Relativity, doing the work with an extended correspondence with Albert Einstein. In 1947, he
                                                announced a result, "Affine Field Theory," in a talk at the Royal Irish Academy, but the announcement
                                                was criticized by Einstein as "preliminary" and failed to lead to the desired unified theory. Following
                                                the failure of his attempt at unification, Schrödinger gave up his work on unification and turned to
                                                other topics.</p>

                                                <p>Schrödinger had a strong interest in psychology, in particular colour perception and colorimetry

                                                Schrödinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics was established in Vienna in 1993.</p>

                                        Niels Bohr, in full Niels Henrik David Bohr, (born October 7, 1885, Copenhagen,
                                        Denmark—died November 18, 1962, Copenhagen), Danish physicist who is generally
                                        regarded as one of the foremost physicists of the 20th century. He was the first
                                        to apply the quantum concept, which restricts the energy of a system to certain
                                        discrete values, to the problem of atomic and molecular structure. For that work
                                        he received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1922. His manifold roles in the
                                        origins and development of quantum physics may be his most-important
                                        contribution, but through his long career his involvements were substantially
                                        broader, both inside and outside the world of physics.

                                                    Copenhagen family. His mother,
                                                    Ellen (née Adler), was the daughter of a prominent Jewish banker.
                                                    His father, Christian, became a

                                                    doubt that he would study
                                                    physics.
                                                    Research and teaching in that field took place in cramped quarters
                                                    at the Polytechnic Institute, leased
                                                    to the University for the purpose. Bohr obtained his doctorate in
                                                    1911 with a dissertation on the
                                                    electron theory of metals.</p>

                                                    proved a particularly happy one.
                                                    Throughout his life, Margrethe was his most-trusted adviser. They

                                                    Only the year before, Rutherford and his collaborators had

                                                    particular orbits determined by the
                                                    quantum of action and that electromagnetic radiation from an atom
                                                    occurred only when an electron jumped
                                                    to a lower-energy orbit. Although radical and unacceptable to most
                                                    physicists at the time, the Bohr
                                                    atomic model was able to account for an ever-increasing number of
                                                    experimental data, famously starting
                                                    with the spectral line series emitted by hydrogen. </p>

                                                <p>AIn the spring of 1916, Bohr was offered a new professorship at the
                                                    University of Copenhagen;
                                                    dedicated to theoretical physics, it was the second professorship in
                                                    physics there. As physics was
                                                    still pursued in the cramped quarters of the Polytechnic Institute,
                                                    it is not surprising that
                                                    already in the spring of 1917 Bohr wrote a long letter to his
                                                    faculty asking for the establishment
                                                    of an Institute for Theoretical Physics. In the inauguration speech
                                                    for his new institute on March
                                                    3, 1921, he stressed, first, that experiments and experimenters were
                                                    indispensable at an institute
                                                    for theoretical physics in order to test the statements of the
                                                    theorists. Second, he expressed his
                                                    ambition to make the new institute a place where the younger
                                                    generation of physicists could propose
                                                    fresh ideas. Starting out with a small staff, Bohr’s institute soon
                                                    accomplished those goals to the
                                                    highest degree.

                                                <p>Already in his 1913 trilogy, Bohr had sought to apply his theory to
                                                    the understanding of the periodic
                                                    table of elements. He improved upon that aspect of his work into the
                                                    early 1920s, by which time he
                                                    had developed an elaborate scheme building up the periodic table by
                                                    adding electrons one after
                                                    another to the atom according to his atomic model. When Bohr was
                                                    awarded the Nobel Prize for his
                                                    work in 1922, the Hungarian physical chemist Georg Hevesy, together
                                                    with the physicist Dirk Coster
                                                    from Holland, were working at Bohr’s institute to establish
                                                    experimentally that the
                                                    as-yet-undiscovered atomic element 72 would behave as predicted by
                                                    Bohr’s theory. They succeeded in
                                                    1923, thus proving both the strength of Bohr’s theory and the truth

                                                    developed the revolutionary quantum

                                                    and a few others then went on to
                                                    develop what came to be known as the Copenhagen interpretation of
                                                    quantum mechanics, which still
                                                    provides a conceptual basis for the theory. A central element of the
                                                    Copenhagen interpretation is
                                                    Bohr’s complementarity principle, presented for the first time in
                                                    1927 at a conference in Como,
                                                    Italy. According to complementarity, on the atomic level a physical
                                                    phenomenon expresses itself
                                                    differently depending on the experimental setup used to observe it.
                                                    Thus, light appears sometimes as
                                                    waves and sometimes as particles. For a complete explanation, both
                                                    aspects, which according to
                                                    classical physics are contradictory, need to be taken into account.
                                                    The other towering figure of
                                                    physics in the 20th century, Albert Einstein, never accepted the
                                                    Copenhagen interpretation, famously
                                                    declaring against its probabilistic implications that “God does not
                                                    play dice.” The discussions
                                                    between Bohr and Einstein, especially at two of the renowned series
                                                    of Solvay Conferences in
                                                    physics, in 1927 and 1930, constitute one of the most-fundamental
                                                    and inspired discussions between
                                                    physicists in the 20th century. For the rest of his life, Bohr
                                                    worked to generalize complementarity
                                                    as a guiding idea applying far beyond physics.</p>

                                                <p>In the early 1930s Bohr found use once more for his fund-raising
                                                    abilities and his vision of a
                                                    fruitful combination of theory and experiment. He realized early
                                                    that the research front in
                                                    theoretical physics was moving from the study of the atom as a whole
                                                    to the study of its nucleus.
                                                    Bohr turned to the Rockefeller Foundation, whose “experimental
                                                    biology” program was designed to
                                                    improve conditions for the life sciences. Together with Hevesy and
                                                    the Danish physiologist August
                                                    Krogh, Bohr applied for support to build a cyclotron—a kind of
                                                    particle accelerator recently
                                                    invented by Ernest O. Lawrence in the United States—as a means to
                                                    pursue biological studies.
                                                    Although Bohr intended to use the cyclotron primarily for
                                                    investigations in nuclear physics, it
                                                    could also produce isotopes of elements involved in organic
                                                    processes, making it possible in
                                                    particular to extend the radioactive indicator method, invented and
                                                    promoted by Hevesy, to
                                                    biological purposes. In addition to the support from the Rockefeller

                                                    nucleus. Thus, after the German
                                                    physicists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in late 1938 had made the

                                                    recently proposed theory of the
                                                    compound nucleus was suggested by two Austrian physicists close to

                                                    Otto Robert Frisch; the explanation was soon confirmed in
                                                    experiments by Meitner and Frisch at the
                                                    institute. By that time, at the beginning of 1939, Bohr was in the
                                                    United States, where a fierce
                                                    race to confirm experimentally the so-called fission of the nucleus

                                                    Adolf Hitler came to power in
                                                    Germany in 1933, as several of his colleagues there were of Jewish
                                                    descent and lost their jobs
                                                    without any prospect of a future in their home country. Bohr used
                                                    his connections with
                                                    well-established foundations—as well as the newly set up Danish
                                                    Committee for the Support of Refugee
                                                    Intellectual Workers, in which he sat on the executive board from
                                                    its creation in 1933—to get
                                                    physicists out of Germany in order for them to spend some time at
                                                    Bohr’s institute before obtaining
                                                    permanent appointment elsewhere, most often in the United States.

                                                <p>After the discovery of fission, Bohr was acutely aware of the
                                                    theoretical possibility of making an
                                                    atomic bomb. However, as he announced in lectures in Denmark and in
                                                    Norway just before the German
                                                    occupation of both countries in April 1940, he considered the
                                                    practical difficulties so prohibitive as
                                                    to prevent the realization of a bomb until well after the war could
                                                    be expected to end. Even when
                                                    Heisenberg at his visit to Copenhagen in 1941 told Bohr about his
                                                    role in a German atomic bomb project,
                                                    Bohr did not waver from that conviction.</p>

                                                <p>In early 1943 Bohr received a secret message from his British
                                                    colleague James Chadwick, inviting
                                                    Bohr to join him in England to do important scientific work.
                                                    Although Chadwick’s letter was vaguely formulated,
                                                    Bohr understood immediately that the work had to do with developing
                                                    an atomic bomb. Still convinced of
                                                    the infeasibility of such a project, Bohr answered that there was
                                                    greater need for him in occupied
                                                    Denmark.</p>

                                                <p>In the fall of 1943, the political situation in Denmark changed
                                                    dramatically after the Danish
                                                    government’s collaboration with the German occupiers broke down.
                                                    After being warned about his imminent
                                                    arrest, Bohr escaped by boat with his family across the narrow sound
                                                    to Sweden. In Stockholm the
                                                    invitation to England was repeated, and Bohr was brought by a
                                                    military airplane to Scotland and then on
                                                    to London. Only a few days later he was joined by his son Aage, a
                                                    fledgling physicist of age 21, who
                                                    would serve as his father’s indispensable sounding board during
                                                    their absence from Denmark.</p>

                                                <p>Upon being briefed about the state of the Allied atomic bomb project
                                                    on his arrival in London, Bohr
                                                    changed his mind immediately about its feasibility. Concerned about
                                                    a corresponding project being
                                                    pursued in Germany, Bohr willingly joined the Allied project. Taking
                                                    part for several weeks at a time in
                                                    the work in Los Alamos, New Mexico, to develop the atomic bomb, he
                                                    made significant technical
                                                    contributions, notably to the design of the so-called initiator for
                                                    the plutonium bomb. His
                                                    most-important role, however, was to serve, in J. Robert
                                                    Oppenheimer’s words, “as a scientific father
                                                    confessor to the younger men.”</p>

                                                <p>
                                                    Early on during his exile, Bohr became convinced that the existence
                                                    of the bomb would “not only seem
                                                    to necessitate but should also, due to the urgency of mutual
                                                    confidence, facilitate a new approach
                                                    to the problems of international relationship.” The first step
                                                    toward avoiding a postwar nuclear
                                                    arms race would be to inform the ally in the war, the Soviet Union,
                                                    of the project. Bohr set out on
                                                    a solitary campaign, during which he even succeeded in obtaining
                                                    personal interviews with British
                                                    Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D.
                                                    Roosevelt. He was unable to convince
                                                    either of them of his viewpoint, however, instead being suspected by
                                                    Churchill of spying for the
                                                    Russians. After the war, Bohr persisted in his mission for what he
                                                    called an “open world” between
                                                    nations, continuing his confidential contact with statesmen and
                                                    writing an open letter to the United
                                                    Nations in 1950.

                                                <p>
                                                    Bohr was allowed to return home only after the atomic bomb had been
                                                    dropped on Japan in August 1945.
                                                    In Denmark he was greeted as a hero, some newspapers even welcoming
                                                    him with pride as the Dane who
                                                    had invented the atomic bomb. He continued to run and expand his
                                                    institute, and he was central in
                                                    postwar institution building for physics. On a national scale, he
                                                    took a major part in establishing
                                                    the research facility at Risø, near Roskilde, only a few miles
                                                    outside Copenhagen, created in order
                                                    to prepare the introduction of nuclear power in Denmark, which,
                                                    however, has never occurred.
                                                    Internationally, he took part in the establishment of CERN, the
                                                    European experimental particle
                                                    physics facility near Geneva, Switzerland, as well as of the Nordic

                                        Werner Heisenberg, in full Werner Karl Heisenberg, (born December 5, 1901,
                                        Würzburg, Germany—died February 1, 1976, Munich, West Germany), German physicist
                                        and philosopher who discovered (1925) a way to formulate quantum mechanics in
                                        terms of matrices. For that discovery, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for
                                        Physics for 1932. In 1927 he published his uncertainty principle, upon which he
                                        built his philosophy and for which he is best known. He also made important
                                        contributions to the theories of the hydrodynamics of turbulent flows, the
                                        atomic nucleus, ferromagnetism, cosmic rays, and subatomic particles, and he was
                                        instrumental in planning the first West German nuclear reactor at Karlsruhe,
                                        together with a research reactor in Munich, in 1957. Considerable controversy
                                        surrounds his work on atomic research during World War II.

                                                    Heisenberg was raised and lived as a Lutheran Christian. His
                                                    autobiography starts with the young
                                                    Heisenberg in his late teenage years, reading Plato's Timaeus while
                                                    hiking in the Bavarian Alps.
                                                    Heisenberg recounted the philosophical conversations with his fellow
                                                    students and teachers on
                                                    understanding the atom while receiving his scientific training in
                                                    Munich, Göttingen and

                                                    Heisenberg’s father, August Heisenberg, a scholar of ancient Greek
                                                    philology and modern Greek
                                                    literature, was a teacher at a gymnasium (classical-humanistic
                                                    secondary school) and lecturer at the
                                                    University of Würzburg. Werner’s mother, née Anna Wecklein, was the
                                                    daughter of the rector of the
                                                    elite Maximilians-Gymnasium in Munich. In 1910 August Heisenberg
                                                    became a professor of Greek
                                                    philology at the University of Munich. Werner entered the
                                                    Maximilians-Gymnasium the following year
                                                    and soon impressed his teachers with his precocity in mathematics.
                                                    Heisenberg entered the University
                                                    of Munich in 1920, becoming a student of Arnold Sommerfeld, an
                                                    expert on atomic spectroscopy and
                                                    exponent of the quantum model of physics. (The idea that certain
                                                    properties in atomic physics are
                                                    not continuous and take on only certain discrete, or quantized,
                                                    values at small scales had been
                                                    developed by Danish physicist Niels Bohr in 1913.) Heisenberg
                                                    finished his formal work for a
                                                    doctorate in 1923 with a dissertation on hydrodynamics.

                                                <p>
                                                    Despite a mediocre dissertation defense, Heisenberg’s real talents
                                                    emerged in his work on the
                                                    anomalous Zeeman effect, in which atomic spectral lines are split
                                                    into multiple components under the
                                                    influence of a magnetic field. Heisenberg developed a model that
                                                    accounted for this phenomenon,
                                                    though at the cost of introducing half-integer quantum numbers, a
                                                    notion at odds with Bohr’s theory
                                                    as understood to date. While still officially Sommerfeld’s student,
                                                    in 1922 Heisenberg became an
                                                    assistant and student of Max Born at the University of Göttingen,
                                                    where Heisenberg also first met
                                                    Bohr. In 1924 Heisenberg completed his habilitation, the

                                                    In 1925, after an extended visit to Bohr’s Institute of Theoretical
                                                    Physics at the University of
                                                    Copenhagen, Heisenberg tackled the problem of spectrum intensities

                                                    position that the theory should be
                                                    based only on observable quantities was central to his paper of July
                                                    1925, “Über quantentheoretische

                                                    upon noncommutative
                                                    multiplication; Born, together with his new assistant Pascual
                                                    Jordan, realized that this could be
                                                    expressed using matrix algebra, which they used in a paper submitted
                                                    for publication in September as

                                                    Heisenberg, and Jordan had

                                                    Other formulations of quantum mechanics were being devised during
                                                    the 1920s: the bracket notation
                                                    (using vectors in a Hilbert space) was developed by P.A.M. Dirac in
                                                    England and the wave equation
                                                    was worked out by Erwin Schrödinger in Switzerland (where the
                                                    Austrian physicist was then working).
                                                    Schrödinger soon demonstrated that the different formulations were
                                                    mathematically equivalent, though
                                                    the physical significance of this equivalence remained unclear.
                                                    Heisenberg again returned to Bohr’s
                                                    institute in Copenhagen, and their conversations on this topic
                                                    culminated in Heisenberg’s landmark
                                                    paper of March 1927, “Über den anschulichen Inhalt der
                                                    quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik”

                                                    This paper articulated the uncertainty, or indeterminacy, principle.
                                                    Quantum mechanics demonstrated,
                                                    according to Heisenberg, that the momentum (p) and position (x) of a
                                                    particle could not both be
                                                    exactly measured simultaneously. Instead, a relation exists between
                                                    the indeterminacies (Δ) in the
                                                    measurement of these variables such that ΔpΔx ≥ h/4π (where h is
                                                    Planck’s constant, or 6.62606957 ×
                                                    10−34 joule∙second). Since there exists a lower limit (h/4π) on the
                                                    product of the uncertainties, if
                                                    the uncertainty in one variable diminishes toward 0, the uncertainty
                                                    in the other must increase
                                                    reciprocally. An analogous relation exists between any pair of
                                                    canonically conjugate variables, such
                                                    as energy and time.

                                                    Heisenberg drew a philosophically profound conclusion: absolute
                                                    causal determinism was impossible,
                                                    since it required exact knowledge of both position and momentum as
                                                    initial conditions. Therefore,
                                                    the use of probabilistic formulations in atomic theory resulted not
                                                    from ignorance but from the
                                                    necessarily indeterministic relationship between the variables. This
                                                    viewpoint was central to the
                                                    so-called “Copenhagen interpretation” of quantum theory, which got
                                                    its name from the strong defense
                                                    for the idea at Bohr’s institute in Copenhagen. Although this became
                                                    a predominant viewpoint,
                                                    several leading physicists, including Schrödinger and Albert
                                                    Einstein, saw the renunciation of
                                                    deterministic causality as physically incomplete.

                                                    In 1927 Heisenberg took up a professorship in Leipzig. In exchange
                                                    with Dirac, Jordan, Wolfgang
                                                    Pauli, and others, he embarked on a research program to create a
                                                    quantum field theory, uniting
                                                    quantum mechanics with relativity theory to comprehend the
                                                    interaction of particles and (force)
                                                    fields. Heisenberg also worked on the theory of the atomic nucleus
                                                    following the discovery of the
                                                    neutron in 1932, developing a model of proton and neutron
                                                    interaction in an early description of
                                                    what decades later came to be known as the strong force. The 1932
                                                    Nobel Prize for Physics was not
                                                    announced until November 1933, when the 1933 winners were also
                                                    announced. Heisenberg was awarded the
                                                    1932 physics prize, while Schrödinger and Dirac shared the 1933
                                                    physics prize.

                                                    The same year that Heisenberg was awarded a Nobel Prize, 1933, also
                                                    saw the rise to power of the
                                                    National Socialist German Workers’ Party (Nazi Party). Nazi policies
                                                    excluding “non-Aryans” or the
                                                    politically “unreliable” from the civil service meant the dismissal
                                                    or resignation of many
                                                    professors and academics—including, for example, Born, Einstein, and
                                                    Schrödinger and several of
                                                    Heisenberg’s students and colleagues in Leipzig. Heisenberg’s
                                                    response was mostly quiet
                                                    interventions within the bureaucracy rather than overt public
                                                    protest, guided by a hope that the
                                                    Nazi regime or its most extreme manifestations would not last long.

                                                    Heisenberg also became the target of ideological attacks. A coterie
                                                    of Nazi-affiliated physicists
                                                    promoted the idea of a “German” or “Aryan” physics, opposed to a
                                                    supposedly “Jewish” influence
                                                    manifested in abstract mathematical approaches—above all, relativity
                                                    and quantum theories. Johannes
                                                    Stark, a leader of this movement, used his Nazi Party connections to
                                                    assert influence over science
                                                    funding and personnel decisions. Sommerfeld had long regarded
                                                    Heisenberg as his eventual successor,
                                                    and in 1937 Heisenberg received a call to join the University of
                                                    Munich. Thereupon the official SS
                                                    journal published an article signed by Stark that called Heisenberg
                                                    a “white Jew” and the “Ossietzky
                                                    of physics.” (German journalist and pacifist Carl von Ossietzky,
                                                    winner of the 1935 Nobel Prize for
                                                    Peace, had been imprisoned in 1931 for treason for his reporting of

                                                    efforts, given amnesty in 1932, and then rearrested and interned in
                                                    a concentration camp by the
                                                    Nazis in 1933.)

                                                <p>
                                                    Heisenberg, relying on the acquaintance of his mother’s family with
                                                    Heinrich Himmler’s family, sent
                                                    a request to the SS chief to intervene on his behalf in acquiring
                                                    the professorship in Munich.
                                                    Himmler, after an investigation, decreed a compromise: Heisenberg
                                                    would not succeed Sommerfeld in
                                                    Munich, but he would be spared further personal attacks and
                                                    (essentially) promised another prominent
                                                    post in the future. Meanwhile, Stark and the Aryan physicists were
                                                    for other reasons losing
                                                    influence in the bureaucratic jungle of the Nazi state, particularly
                                                    in the context of
                                                    militarization. Amid this political turbulence, Heisenberg
                                                    apparently never seriously contemplated
                                                    leaving Germany, though he certainly received several offers of
                                                    university appointments in the
                                                    United States and elsewhere. Apparently, he was guided by a strong
                                                    sense of personal duty to the
                                                    profession and a national loyalty that (in his mind) transcended the
                                                    particular politics of the
                                                    regime.
                                                </p>

                                                    In 1937 Heisenberg married Elisabeth Schumacher, the daughter of an
                                                    economics professor, whom he had
                                                    met at a concert. Twins were born the next year, the first of
                                                    eventually seven children for the
                                                    couple.

                                                    Heisenberg’s main focus of work in the late 1930s was high-energy
                                                    cosmic rays, for which he proposed
                                                    a theory of “explosion showers,” in which multiple particles were
                                                    produced in a single process, in
                                                    contrast to the “cascade” theory principally favoured by British and
                                                    American physicists. Heisenberg
                                                    also saw in cosmic-ray phenomena possible evidence for his idea of a
                                                    minimum length marking a lower
                                                    boundary of the domain of quantum mechanics.

                                                    The discovery of nuclear fission pushed the atomic nucleus into the
                                                    centre of attention. After the
                                                    German invasion of Poland in 1939, Heisenberg was drafted to work
                                                    for the Army Weapons Bureau on the
                                                    problem of nuclear energy. At first commuting between Leipzig and
                                                    the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute (KWI)
                                                    for Physics in Berlin and, after 1942, as director at the latter,
                                                    Heisenberg took on a leading role
                                                    in Germany’s nuclear research. Given the Nazi context, this role has
                                                    been enormously controversial.
                                                    Heisenberg’s research group was unsuccessful, of course, in
                                                    producing a reactor or an atomic bomb.
                                                    In explanation, some accounts have presented Heisenberg as simply
                                                    incompetent; others, conversely,
                                                    have suggested that he deliberately delayed or sabotaged the effort.
                                                    It is clear in retrospect that
                                                    there were indeed critical mistakes at several points in the
                                                    research. Likewise, it is apparent that
                                                    the German nuclear weapons project as a whole was not possessed of
                                                    the same degree of enthusiasm
                                                    that pervaded the Manhattan Project in the United States. However,
                                                    factors outside Heisenberg’s
                                                    direct control had a more substantive role in the outcome.

                                                <p>
                                                    In contrast to the unified Anglo-American effort, the German project
                                                    was bureaucratically fractured
                                                    and cut off from international collaboration. Key materials were in
                                                    short supply in Germany, to say
                                                    nothing of the widespread dislocations caused by Allied bombing of
                                                    the country’s transportation
                                                    network. Moreover, the overall strategic perspective critically
                                                    affected the prioritization or
                                                    de-prioritization of nuclear bomb research. After a 1942 conference
                                                    with Axis scientists, German
                                                    minister for armaments and war production Albert Speer concluded
                                                    that reactor research should
                                                    proceed but that any bomb was unlikely to be developed in time for
                                                    use in the war. By way of
                                                    confirmation, the official start of the Manhattan Project in the
                                                    United States also occurred in
                                                    1942, and, even with its massive effort, it could not produce an
                                                    atomic bomb before Germany’s
                                                    surrender.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Controversy has also swirled around Heisenberg’s lectures in
                                                    countries such as Denmark and the
                                                    Netherlands during the war years. These trips outside of Germany
                                                    were necessarily taken with the
                                                    approval of German authorities and hence were perceived by
                                                    colleagues in the occupied countries as
                                                    indicating Nazi leaders’ endorsement of Heisenberg and vice versa.
                                                    Most notorious in this regard was
                                                    a trip to Copenhagen in September 1941, during which Heisenberg
                                                    raised the subject of nuclear
                                                    weapons research in a conversation with Bohr, offending and alarming
                                                    the latter, though Heisenberg
                                                    later claimed that Bohr’s reaction rested on some misunderstanding.
                                                    The exact content of the
                                                    conversation has never been clarified.

                                                    By January 1945 the KWI for Physics was evacuated to the towns of
                                                    Hechingen and Haigerloch in the
                                                    province of Hohenzollern (then a Prussian enclave, now part of the
                                                    state of Baden-Württemberg). In
                                                    the closing days of the war, Heisenberg bicycled from there to his
                                                    family’s vacation house in
                                                    Bavaria. There he was captured by an American military intelligence
                                                    team, and eventually he was
                                                    interned with several other German physicists in England. Their
                                                    conversations after news of the
                                                    atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, initially suggested that
                                                    Heisenberg had no clear sense of some
                                                    basic principles of bomb design—e.g., the approximate critical
                                                    mass—but within a few days he had
                                                    solved many of these problems.

                                                    Heisenberg was released by the British authorities in January 1946,
                                                    and soon thereafter he resumed
                                                    his directorship of the reconstituted Kaiser Wilhelm, which was soon
                                                    renamed the Max Planck
                                                    Institute for Physics, now in Göttingen. In the postwar years,
                                                    Heisenberg took on a variety of roles
                                                    as an administrator of and spokesman for German science within West
                                                    Germany, a shift to a more
                                                    overtly political role that was in some contrast to his more
                                                    apolitical stance before 1945. In 1949
                                                    Heisenberg became the first president of the German Research
                                                    Council, a consortium of the Max Planck
                                                    Society and the various West German academies of science that sought
                                                    to promote German science in
                                                    the international arena and to influence federal science funding
                                                    through the newly elected
                                                    chancellor Konrad Adenauer. However, this new organization
                                                    encountered conflict with the older, now
                                                    re-established Emergency Association for German Science, whose
                                                    approach preserved the traditional
                                                    primacy of the various German states in cultural and educational
                                                    matters.

                                                <p>
                                                    In 1951 the Research Council merged with the Emergency Association
                                                    to form the German Research Association. Beginning in
                                                    1952, Heisenberg was instrumental in Germany’s participation in the
                                                    creation of the European Council
                                                    for Nuclear Research (CERN). In 1953 Heisenberg became the founding
                                                    president of the third iteration
                                                    of the Humboldt Foundation, a government-funded organization that
                                                    provided fellowships for foreign
                                                    scholars to conduct research in Germany. Despite these close

                                                    government, Heisenberg also became an overt critic of Adenauer’s
                                                    policies as one of the “Göttingen
                                                    18” in 1957; following the government’s announcement that it was

                                                    issued a manifesto protesting the
                                                    plan.

                                                    In the postwar period Heisenberg continued his search for a
                                                    comprehensive quantum field theory,
                                                    utilizing the “scattering matrix” approach (first introduced in
                                                    1942) and returning to the notion of
                                                    a minimum universal length as a key feature. In 1958 he proposed a
                                                    unified field theory—newspaper
                                                    stories referred to his “world formula”—which he saw as a
                                                    symmetry-based approach to the
                                                    proliferation of particles then under way. However, support from the
                                                    physics community was limited,
                                                    particularly with the appearance of the quark model in the 1960s. In
                                                    1958 Heisenberg also finally
                                                    achieved the goal of an academic position in Munich, as the Max
                                                    Planck Institute for Physics moved
                                                    there in that year. Heisenberg retired from his institute
                                                    directorship in 1970.

                                        theoretical physicist whose theory of exploding black holes drew upon both
                                        relativity theory and quantum mechanics. He also worked with space-time
                                        singularities.

                                                    Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 in Oxford to Frank (1905–1986)
                                                    and Isobel Eileen
                                                    Hawking (née Walker; 1915–2013). Hawking's mother was born into a
                                                    family of doctors in
                                                    Glasgow, Scotland. His wealthy paternal great-grandfather, from
                                                    Yorkshire, over-extended
                                                    himself buying farm land and then went bankrupt in the great
                                                    agricultural depression during the
                                                    early 20th century. His paternal great-grandmother saved the family
                                                    from financial ruin by
                                                    opening a school in their home. Despite their families' financial
                                                    constraints, both parents
                                                    attended the University of Oxford, where Frank read medicine and
                                                    Isobel read Philosophy, Politics
                                                    and Economics. Isobel worked as a secretary for a medical research
                                                    institute, and Frank was a
                                                    medical researcher. Hawking had two younger sisters, Philippa and
                                                    Mary, and an adopted
                                                    brother, Edward Frank David (1955–2003).

                                                    Hawking began his schooling at the Byron House School in Highgate,
                                                    London. He later blamed its
                                                    "progressive methods" for his failure to learn to read while at the
                                                    school. In St Albans, the
                                                    eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for
                                                    a few months. At that time,
                                                    younger boys could attend one of the houses.

                                                <p>
                                                    Hawking attended two independent (i.e. fee-paying) schools, first
                                                    Radlett School and from
                                                    September 1952, St Albans School, after passing the eleven-plus a
                                                    year early. The family
                                                    placed a high value on education. Hawking's father wanted his son to
                                                    attend the well-regarded
                                                    Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day
                                                    of the scholarship examination. His
                                                    family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of
                                                    a scholarship, so Hawking
                                                    remained at St Albans. A positive consequence was that Hawking
                                                    remained close to a group of
                                                    friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of
                                                    fireworks, model aeroplanes and
                                                    boats, and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory
                                                    perception. From 1958 on, with
                                                    the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a
                                                    computer from clock parts, an old
                                                    telephone switchboard and other recycled components.

                                                    Although known at school as "Einstein", Hawking was not initially
                                                    successful academically. With
                                                    time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects
                                                    and, inspired by Tahta, decided
                                                    to read mathematics at university. Hawking's father advised him to
                                                    study medicine,
                                                    concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates. He
                                                    also wanted his son to attend
                                                    University College, Oxford, his own alma mater. As it was not
                                                    possible to read mathematics there at
                                                    the time, Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry. Despite
                                                    his headmaster's advice to wait
                                                    until the next year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking
                                                    the examinations in March
                                                    1959.

                                                    Hawking began his university education at University College,
                                                    Oxford, in October 1959 at the age
                                                    of 17. For the first 18 months, he was bored and lonely – he found
                                                    the academic work
                                                    "ridiculously easy". His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said,
                                                    "It was only necessary
                                                    for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it
                                                    without looking to see how other
                                                    people did it." A change occurred during his second and third year
                                                    when, according to Berman,
                                                    Hawking made more of an effort "to be one of the boys". He developed
                                                    into a popular, lively and
                                                    witty college member, interested in classical music and science
                                                    fiction. Part of the
                                                    transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat
                                                    club, the University College Boat
                                                    Club, where he coxed a rowing crew. The rowing coach at the time
                                                    noted that Hawking
                                                    cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses
                                                    that led to damaged boats.
                                                    Hawking estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three
                                                    years at Oxford. These
                                                    unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, and
                                                    he decided to answer only
                                                    theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual
                                                    knowledge. A first-class honours
                                                    degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study
                                                    in cosmology at the University
                                                    of Cambridge. Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the
                                                    examinations, and the final
                                                    result was on the borderline between first- and second-class
                                                    honours, making a viva (oral
                                                    examination) with the Oxford examiners necessary.

                                                <p>
                                                    Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult
                                                    student. So, when asked at the viva
                                                    to describe his plans, he said, "If you award me a First, I will go
                                                    to Cambridge. If I receive a
                                                    Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a
                                                    First." He was held in higher
                                                    regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners "were
                                                    intelligent enough to realise they
                                                    were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves". After
                                                    receiving a first-class BA
                                                    (Hons.) degree in physics and completing a trip to Iran with a
                                                    friend, he began his graduate work at
                                                    Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962.

                                                    Hawking's first year as a doctoral student was difficult. He was
                                                    initially disappointed to find that
                                                    he had been assigned Dennis William Sciama, one of the founders of
                                                    modern cosmology, as a supervisor
                                                    rather than noted Yorkshire astronomer Fred Hoyle, and he found his
                                                    training in mathematics
                                                    inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology. After being
                                                    diagnosed with motor
                                                    neurone disease, Hawking fell into a depression – though his doctors
                                                    advised that he continue with
                                                    his studies, he felt there was little point. His disease progressed
                                                    more slowly than doctors had
                                                    predicted. Although Hawking had difficulty walking unsupported, and
                                                    his speech was almost
                                                    unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to
                                                    live proved unfounded. With
                                                    Sciama's encouragement, he returned to his work. Hawking started
                                                    developing a reputation for
                                                    brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of
                                                    Fred Hoyle and his student Jayant
                                                    Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964.

                                                    When Hawking began his graduate studies, there was much debate in
                                                    the physics community about the
                                                    prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the Big Bang
                                                    and Steady State theories.
                                                    Inspired by Roger Penrose's theorem of a spacetime singularity in
                                                    the centre of black holes, Hawking
                                                    applied the same thinking to the entire universe; and, during 1965,
                                                    he wrote his thesis on this
                                                    topic. Hawking's thesis was approved in 1966. There were other
                                                    positive
                                                    developments: Hawking received a research fellowship at Gonville and
                                                    Caius College at Cambridge;
                                                    he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical
                                                    physics, specialising in general
                                                    relativity and cosmology, in March 1966; and his essay
                                                    "Singularities and the Geometry of
                                                    Space-Time" shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that

                                                    diagnosed with motor neuron disease. In October 1964, the couple
                                                    became engaged to marry, aware of

                                                    limitations. Hawking later said that the engagement gave him
                                                    "something to live for".
                                                    The two were married on 14 July 1965 in their shared hometown of St
                                                    Albans.

                                                    The couple resided in Cambridge, within Hawking's walking distance
                                                    to the Department of Applied
                                                    Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP). During their first
                                                    years of marriage, Jane lived in
                                                    London during the week as she completed her degree at Westfield
                                                    College. They travelled to the
                                                    United States several times for conferences and physics-related
                                                    visits. Jane began a PhD programme
                                                    through Westfield College in medieval Spanish poetry (completed in
                                                    1981). The couple had three
                                                    children: Robert, born May 1967, Lucy, born November 1969, and
                                                    Timothy, born April
                                                    1979.

                                                    Hawking rarely discussed his illness and physical challenges, even –
                                                    in a precedent set during their
                                                    courtship – with Jane. His disabilities meant that the
                                                    responsibilities of home and family
                                                    rested firmly on his wife's increasingly overwhelmed shoulders,
                                                    leaving him more time to think about
                                                    physics. Upon his appointment in 1974 to a year-long position at the
                                                    California Institute of
                                                    Technology in Pasadena, California, Jane proposed that a graduate or
                                                    post-doctoral student live with
                                                    them and help with his care. Hawking accepted, and Bernard Carr
                                                    travelled with them as the first of
                                                    many students who fulfilled this role. The family spent a generally
                                                    happy and stimulating
                                                    year in Pasadena.

                                                    Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a new home and a new job,
                                                    as reader. Don Page, with whom
                                                    Hawking had begun a close friendship at Caltech, arrived to work as
                                                    the live-in graduate student
                                                    assistant. With Page's help and that of a secretary, Jane's
                                                    responsibilities were reduced so she
                                                    could return to her doctoral thesis and her new interest in singing.

                                                    Around December 1977, Jane met organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones when
                                                    singing in a church choir.
                                                    Hellyer Jones became close to the Hawking family, and by the
                                                    mid-1980s, he and Jane had developed
                                                    romantic feelings for each other. According to Jane, her husband was
                                                    accepting of the
                                                    situation, stating "he would not object so long as I continued to
                                                    love him". Jane and
                                                    Hellyer Jones determined not to break up the family, and their
                                                    relationship remained platonic for a
                                                    long period.

                                                    By the 1980s, Hawking's marriage had been strained for many years.
                                                    Jane felt overwhelmed by the
                                                    intrusion into their family life of the required nurses and
                                                    assistants. The impact of his
                                                    celebrity was challenging for colleagues and family members, while
                                                    the prospect of living up to a
                                                    worldwide fairytale image was daunting for the couple. Hawking's
                                                    views of religion also
                                                    contrasted with her strong Christian faith and resulted in tension.
                                                    After a
                                                    tracheotomy in 1985, Hawking required a nurse 24/7 and nursing care
                                                    was split across 3 shifts daily.
                                                    In the late 1980s, Hawking grew close to one of his nurses, Elaine
                                                    Mason, to the dismay of some
                                                    colleagues, caregivers, and family members, who were disturbed by
                                                    her strength of personality and
                                                    protectiveness. In February 1990, Hawking told Jane that he was
                                                    leaving her for Mason, and
                                                    departed the family home. After his divorce from Jane in 1995,
                                                    Hawking married Mason in
                                                    September, declaring, "It's wonderful – I have married the woman I
                                                    love."

                                                    In 1999, Jane Hawking published a memoir, Music to Move the Stars,
                                                    describing her marriage to
                                                    Hawking and its breakdown. Its revelations caused a sensation in the
                                                    media but, as was his usual
                                                    practice regarding his personal life, Hawking made no public comment
                                                    except to say that he did not
                                                    read biographies about himself. After his second marriage, Hawking's
                                                    family felt excluded and
                                                    marginalised from his life. For a period of about five years in the
                                                    early 2000s, his
                                                    family and staff became increasingly worried that he was being
                                                    physically abused. Police
                                                    investigations took place, but were closed as Hawking refused to
                                                    make a complaint.

                                                    In 2006, Hawking and Mason quietly divorced, and Hawking resumed
                                                    closer relationships with
                                                    Jane, his children, and his grandchildren. Reflecting on this
                                                    happier period, a revised
                                                    version of Jane's book, re-titled Travelling to Infinity: My Life

                                                    Hawking had a rare early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neuron
                                                    disease (MND; also known as

                                                    Hawking had experienced increasing clumsiness during his final year
                                                    at Oxford, including a fall on
                                                    some stairs and difficulties when rowing. The problems worsened, and
                                                    his speech became
                                                    slightly slurred and his family noticed the changes when he returned
                                                    home for Christmas, and medical
                                                    investigations were begun. The MND diagnosis came when Hawking was
                                                    21, in 1963. At the

                                                    to use crutches and could no
                                                    longer give lectures regularly. As he slowly lost the ability to
                                                    write, he developed
                                                    compensatory visual methods, including seeing equations in terms of
                                                    geometry. The
                                                    physicist Werner Israel later compared the achievements to Mozart
                                                    composing an entire symphony in
                                                    his head. Hawking was fiercely independent and unwilling to accept
                                                    help or make
                                                    concessions for his disabilities. He preferred to be regarded as "a
                                                    scientist first, popular science
                                                    writer second, and, in all the ways that matter, a normal human
                                                    being with the same desires, drives,
                                                    dreams, and ambitions as the next person." His wife, Jane Hawking,
                                                    later noted: "Some people
                                                    would call it determination, some obstinacy. I've called it both at
                                                    one time or another." He
                                                    required much persuasion to accept the use of a wheelchair at the
                                                    end of the 1960s, but
                                                    ultimately became notorious for the wildness of his wheelchair
                                                    driving. Hawking was a popular
                                                    and witty colleague, but his illness, as well as his reputation for
                                                    brashness, distanced him from
                                                    some.

                                                    When Hawking first began using a wheelchair in the late 1970s he was
                                                    using standard motorised
                                                    models. The earliest surviving example of these chairs was made by
                                                    BEC Mobility and sold by
                                                    Christie's in November 2018 for £296,750. Hawking continued to use
                                                    this type of chair until the
                                                    early 1990s, at which time his ability to use his hands to drive a
                                                    wheelchair deteriorated. Hawking
                                                    used a variety of different chairs from that time, including a

                                                    powerchair from 2007, as shown in the April 2008 photo of Hawking

                                                    Hawking's speech deteriorated, and by the late 1970s he could be
                                                    understood by only his family and
                                                    closest friends. To communicate with others, someone who knew him
                                                    well would interpret his speech
                                                    into intelligible speech. Spurred by a dispute with the university
                                                    over who would pay for the
                                                    ramp needed for him to enter his workplace, Hawking and his wife
                                                    campaigned for improved access and
                                                    support for those with disabilities in Cambridge, including adapted
                                                    student housing at the
                                                    university. In general, Hawking had ambivalent feelings about his
                                                    role as a disability rights
                                                    champion: while wanting to help others, he also sought to detach
                                                    himself from his illness and its
                                                    challenges. His lack of engagement in this area led to some
                                                    criticism.

                                                    During a visit to CERN on the border of France and Switzerland in
                                                    mid-1985, Hawking contracted
                                                    pneumonia, which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so
                                                    ill that Jane was asked if life
                                                    support should be terminated. She refused, but the consequence was a
                                                    tracheotomy, which required
                                                    round-the-clock nursing care and the removal of what remained of his
                                                    speech. The National
                                                    Health Service was ready to pay for a nursing home, but Jane was
                                                    determined that he would live at
                                                    home. The cost of the care was funded by an American foundation.
                                                    Nurses were hired for the
                                                    three shifts required to provide the round-the-clock support he
                                                    required. One of those employed was
                                                    Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife.

                                                    For his communication, Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to
                                                    choose letters on a spelling
                                                    card, but in 1986 he received a computer program called the
                                                    "Equalizer" from Walter Woltosz,
                                                    CEO of Words Plus, who had developed an earlier version of the
                                                    software to help his mother-in-law,
                                                    who also suffered from ALS and had lost her ability to speak and
                                                    write. In a method he used for
                                                    the rest of his life, Hawking could now simply press a switch to
                                                    select phrases, words or letters
                                                    from a bank of about 2,500–3,000 that were scanned. The program was
                                                    originally run on a
                                                    desktop computer. Elaine Mason's husband, David, a computer
                                                    engineer, adapted a small computer and
                                                    attached it to his wheelchair.

                                                <p>
                                                    Released from the need to use somebody to interpret his speech,
                                                    Hawking commented that "I can
                                                    communicate better now than before I lost my voice." The voice he
                                                    used had an American accent
                                                    and is no longer produced. Despite the later availability of other
                                                    voices, Hawking
                                                    retained this original voice, saying that he preferred it and
                                                    identified with it. Originally,
                                                    Hawking activated a switch using his hand and could produce up to 15
                                                    words a minute. Lectures
                                                    were prepared in advance and were sent to the speech synthesizer in
                                                    short sections to be
                                                    delivered.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Hawking gradually lost the use of his hand, and in 2005 he began to
                                                    control his communication device
                                                    with movements of his cheek muscles, with a rate of about one word
                                                    per minute.
                                                    With this decline there was a risk of his developing locked-in
                                                    syndrome, so Hawking collaborated
                                                    with Intel researchers on systems that could translate his brain
                                                    patterns or facial expressions into
                                                    switch activations. After several prototypes that did not perform as
                                                    planned, they settled on an
                                                    adaptive word predictor made by the London-based startup SwiftKey,
                                                    which used a system similar to
                                                    his original technology. Hawking had an easier time adapting to the
                                                    new system, which was further
                                                    developed after inputting large amounts of Hawking's papers and
                                                    other written materials and uses
                                                    predictive software similar to other smartphone keyboards.

                                                    By 2009, he could no longer drive his wheelchair independently, but
                                                    the same people who created his
                                                    new typing mechanics were working on a method to drive his chair
                                                    using movements made by his chin.
                                                    This proved difficult, since Hawking could not move his neck, and
                                                    trials showed that while he could
                                                    indeed drive the chair, the movement was sporadic and jumpy. Near
                                                    the end of his life,
                                                    Hawking experienced increased breathing difficulties, often
                                                    resulting in his requiring the usage of
                                                    a ventilator, and being regularly hospitalised.

                                                <p>
                                                    In late 2006, Hawking revealed in a BBC interview that one of his
                                                    greatest unfulfilled desires was
                                                    to travel to space; on hearing this, Richard Branson offered a free
                                                    flight into space with
                                                    Virgin Galactic, which Hawking immediately accepted. Besides
                                                    personal ambition, he was motivated by
                                                    the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show
                                                    the potential of people with
                                                    disabilities. On 26 April 2007, Hawking flew aboard a
                                                    specially-modified Boeing 727-200 jet
                                                    operated by Zero-G Corp off the coast of Florida to experience
                                                    weightlessness. Fears the
                                                    manoeuvres would cause him undue discomfort proved groundless, and
                                                    the flight was extended to eight
                                                    parabolic arcs. It was described as a successful test to see if he
                                                    could withstand the g-forces
                                                    involved in space flight. At the time, the date of Hawking's trip to
                                                    space was projected to be
                                                    as early as 2009, but commercial flights to space did not commence
                                                    before his death.

                                                    Hawking was a longstanding Labour Party supporter. He recorded a
                                                    tribute for the 2000
                                                    Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore, called the 2003 invasion

                                                    crime", supported the academic boycott of Israel, campaigned for
                                                    nuclear
                                                    disarmament, and supported stem cell research, universal health
                                                    care, and
                                                    action to prevent climate change. In August 2014, Hawking was one of
                                                    200 public figures who
                                                    were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope
                                                    that Scotland would vote to
                                                    remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that
                                                    issue. Hawking believed a
                                                    United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit) would
                                                    damage the UK's contribution to
                                                    science as modern research needs international collaboration, and
                                                    that free movement of people in
                                                    Europe encourages the spread of ideas. Hawking was disappointed by
                                                    Brexit and warned against
                                                    envy and isolationism.

                                                    Hawking was greatly concerned over health care, and maintained that
                                                    without the UK National Health
                                                    Service, he could not have survived into his 70s. He stated, "I
                                                    have received excellent medical
                                                    attention in Britain, and I felt it was important to set the record
                                                    straight. I believe in universal
                                                    health care. And I am not afraid to say so."

                                                    Hawking feared privatisation. He stated, "The more profit is
                                                    extracted from the system, the more
                                                    private monopolies grow and the more expensive healthcare becomes.
                                                    The NHS must be preserved from
                                                    commercial interests and protected from those who want to privatise
                                                    it." Hawking alleged
                                                    ministers damaged the NHS, he blamed the Conservatives for cutting
                                                    funding, weakening the NHS by
                                                    privatisation, lowering staff morale through holding pay back and
                                                    reducing social care. Hawking
                                                    accused Jeremy Hunt of cherry picking evidence which Hawking
                                                    maintained debased science.
                                                    Hawking also stated, "There is overwhelming evidence that NHS
                                                    funding and the numbers of doctors and
                                                    nurses are inadequate, and it is getting worse."

                                                    In June 2017, Hawking endorsed the Labour Party in the 2017 UK
                                                    general election, citing the
                                                    Conservatives' proposed cuts to the NHS. But he was also critical of
                                                    Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn,
                                                    expressing scepticism over whether the party could win a general
                                                    election under him.

                                                    Hawking feared Donald Trump's policies on global warming could
                                                    endanger the planet and make global
                                                    warming irreversible. He said, "Climate change is one of the great
                                                    dangers we face, and it's one we
                                                    can prevent if we act now. By denying the evidence for climate

                                                    Hawking further stated that this could
                                                    lead Earth "to become like Venus, with a temperature of two hundred

                                                    first explored in his doctoral thesis. This included not only the

                                                    and fits any of the models of
                                                    physical cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann, then it must

                                                    singularity. In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created
                                                    Fellowship for Distinction in
                                                    Science to remain at Caius.

                                                    In 1970, Hawking postulated what became known as the second law of
                                                    black hole dynamics, that the
                                                    event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller. With James
                                                    M. Bardeen and Brandon Carter,
                                                    he proposed the four laws of black hole mechanics, drawing an
                                                    analogy with thermodynamics. To
                                                    Hawking's irritation, Jacob Bekenstein, a graduate student of John
                                                    Wheeler, went further—and
                                                    ultimately correctly—to apply thermodynamic concepts literally.

                                                    In the early 1970s, Hawking's work with Carter, Werner Israel, and
                                                    David C. Robinson strongly
                                                    supported Wheeler's no-hair theorem, one that states that no matter
                                                    what the original material from
                                                    which a black hole is created, it can be completely described by the
                                                    properties of mass, electrical
                                                    charge and rotation. His essay titled "Black Holes" won the Gravity

                                                    Award in January 1971. Hawking's first book, The Large Scale
                                                    Structure of Space-Time, written
                                                    with George Ellis, was published in 1973.

                                                    Beginning in 1973, Hawking moved into the study of quantum gravity
                                                    and quantum mechanics.
                                                    His work in this area was spurred by a visit to Moscow and
                                                    discussions with Yakov Borisovich
                                                    Zel'dovich and Alexei Starobinsky, whose work showed that according
                                                    to the uncertainty principle,
                                                    rotating black holes emit particles. To Hawking's annoyance, his
                                                    much-checked calculations
                                                    produced findings that contradicted his second law, which claimed
                                                    black holes could never get
                                                    smaller, and supported Bekenstein's reasoning about their entropy.

                                                    His results, which Hawking presented from 1974, showed that black
                                                    holes emit radiation, known today
                                                    as Hawking radiation, which may continue until they exhaust their
                                                    energy and
                                                    evaporate. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the
                                                    late 1970s and
                                                    following the publication of further research, the discovery was
                                                    widely accepted as a significant
                                                    breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was elected a Fellow of
                                                    the Royal
                                                    Society (FRS) in 1974, a few weeks after the announcement of Hawking
                                                    radiation. At the time, he was
                                                    one of the youngest scientists to become a Fellow.

                                                    Hawking was appointed to the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished
                                                    visiting professorship at the
                                                    California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1974. He worked with
                                                    a friend on the faculty, Kip
                                                    Thorne, and engaged him in a scientific wager about whether the
                                                    X-ray source Cygnus X-1 was
                                                    a black hole. The wager was an "insurance policy" against the
                                                    proposition that black holes did not
                                                    exist. Hawking acknowledged that he had lost the bet in 1990, a bet
                                                    that was the first of
                                                    several he was to make with Thorne and others. Hawking had
                                                    maintained ties to Caltech, spending
                                                    a month there almost every year since this first visit.

                                                    Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a more academically senior
                                                    post, as reader in gravitational
                                                    physics. The mid to late 1970s were a period of growing public
                                                    interest in black holes and the
                                                    physicists who were studying them. Hawking was regularly interviewed
                                                    for print and
                                                    television. He also received increasing academic recognition of his
                                                    work. In 1975, he
                                                    was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal, and
                                                    in 1976 the Dannie Heineman
                                                    Prize, the Maxwell Medal and Prize and the Hughes Medal. He was
                                                    appointed a professor with
                                                    a chair in gravitational physics in 1977. The following year he
                                                    received the Albert Einstein
                                                    Medal and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.

                                                    In 1979, Hawking was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at
                                                    the University of
                                                    Cambridge. His inaugural lecture in this role was titled: "Is the
                                                    End in Sight for
                                                    Theoretical Physics?" and proposed N=8 Supergravity as the leading
                                                    theory to solve many of the
                                                    outstanding problems physicists were studying. His promotion
                                                    coincided with a health crisis
                                                    which led to his accepting, albeit reluctantly, some nursing
                                                    services at home. At the same
                                                    time, he was also making a transition in his approach to physics,
                                                    becoming more intuitive and
                                                    speculative rather than insisting on mathematical proofs. "I would
                                                    rather be right than rigorous",
                                                    he told Kip Thorne. In 1981, he proposed that information in a black
                                                    hole is irretrievably lost
                                                    when a black hole evaporates. This information paradox violates the
                                                    fundamental tenet of quantum
                                                    mechanics, and led to years of debate, including "the Black Hole

                                                    theory. Hawking also began a new line of quantum theory research
                                                    into the origin of
                                                    the universe. In 1981 at a Vatican conference, he presented work
                                                    suggesting that there might be no
                                                    boundary – or beginning or ending – to the universe.

                                                    Hawking subsequently developed the research in collaboration with
                                                    Jim Hartle, and in 1983 they
                                                    published a model, known as the Hartle–Hawking state. It proposed
                                                    that prior to the Planck epoch,
                                                    the universe had no boundary in space-time; before the Big Bang,
                                                    time did not exist and the concept
                                                    of the beginning of the universe is meaningless. The initial
                                                    singularity of the classical Big
                                                    Bang models was replaced with a region akin to the North Pole. One
                                                    cannot travel north of the North
                                                    Pole, but there is no boundary there – it is simply the point where
                                                    all north-running lines meet and
                                                    end. Initially, the no-boundary proposal predicted a closed
                                                    universe, which had
                                                    implications about the existence of God. As Hawking explained, "If
                                                    the universe has no boundaries
                                                    but is self-contained... then God would not have had any freedom to
                                                    choose how the universe
                                                    began."

                                                    Hawking did not rule out the existence of a Creator, asking in A
                                                    Brief History of Time "Is the
                                                    unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own
                                                    existence?" In his early work,
                                                    Hawking spoke of God in a metaphorical sense. In A Brief History of
                                                    Time he wrote: "If we discover a
                                                    complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason –
                                                    for then we should know the mind
                                                    of God." In the same book he suggested that the existence of God was
                                                    not necessary to explain
                                                    the origin of the universe. Later discussions with Neil Turok led to
                                                    the realisation that the
                                                    existence of God was also compatible with an open universe.

                                                    Further work by Hawking in the area of arrows of time led to the
                                                    1985 publication of a paper
                                                    theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then
                                                    when the universe stopped
                                                    expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards. A

                                                    independent calculations by Raymond Laflamme led Hawking to withdraw
                                                    this concept. Honours
                                                    continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the American
                                                    Franklin Medal, and in the 1982
                                                    New Year Honours appointed a Commander of the Order of the British
                                                    Empire (CBE).
                                                    These awards did not significantly change Hawking's financial
                                                    status, and motivated by the need to
                                                    finance his children's education and home expenses, he decided in
                                                    1982 to write a popular book about
                                                    the universe that would be accessible to the general public. Instead

                                                    academic press, he signed a contract with Bantam Books, a mass
                                                    market publisher, and received a
                                                    large advance for his book. A first draft of the book, called A

                                                    completed in 1984.

                                                    One of the first messages Hawking produced with his
                                                    speech-generating device was a request for his
                                                    assistant to help him finish writing A Brief History of Time. Peter
                                                    Guzzardi, his editor at
                                                    Bantam, pushed him to explain his ideas clearly in non-technical
                                                    language, a process that required
                                                    many revisions from an increasingly irritated Hawking. The book was
                                                    published in April 1988 in
                                                    the US and in June in the UK, and it proved to be an extraordinary
                                                    success, rising quickly to the
                                                    top of best-seller lists in both countries and remaining there for
                                                    months. The book
                                                    was translated into many languages, and ultimately sold an estimated
                                                    9 million copies.

                                                    Media attention was intense, and a Newsweek magazine cover and a

                                                    described him as "Master of the Universe". Success led to
                                                    significant financial rewards, but
                                                    also the challenges of celebrity status. Hawking travelled
                                                    extensively to promote his work, and
                                                    enjoyed partying and dancing into the small hours. A difficulty
                                                    refusing the invitations and
                                                    visitors left him limited time for work and his students. Some
                                                    colleagues were resentful of the
                                                    attention Hawking received, feeling it was due to his disability.

                                                    Hawking pursued his work in physics: in 1993 he co-edited a book on
                                                    Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary
                                                    Gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on
                                                    black holes and the Big Bang. In
                                                    1994, at Cambridge's Newton Institute, Hawking and Penrose delivered
                                                    a series of six lectures that were
                                                    published in 1996 as "The Nature of Space and Time". In 1997, he
                                                    conceded a 1991 public scientific
                                                    wager made with Kip Thorne and John Preskill of Caltech. Hawking had
                                                    bet that Penrose's proposal of a
                                                    "cosmic censorship conjecture" – that there could be no "naked
                                                    singularities" unclothed within a horizon
                                                    – was correct.

                                                    After discovering his concession might have been premature, a new
                                                    and more refined wager was made. This
                                                    one specified that such singularities would occur without extra
                                                    conditions. The same year, Thorne,
                                                    Hawking and Preskill made another bet, this time concerning the

                                                    paradox. Thorne and Hawking argued that since general relativity
                                                    made it impossible for black
                                                    holes to radiate and lose information, the mass-energy and
                                                    information carried by Hawking radiation must
                                                    be "new", and not from inside the black hole event horizon. Since
                                                    this contradicted the quantum
                                                    mechanics of microcausality, quantum mechanics theory would need to
                                                    be rewritten. Preskill argued the
                                                    opposite, that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information
                                                    emitted by a black hole relates to
                                                    information that fell in at an earlier time, the concept of black
                                                    holes given by general relativity must
                                                    be modified in some way.

                                                    Hawking also maintained his public profile, including bringing
                                                    science to a wider audience. A film
                                                    version of A Brief History of Time, directed by Errol Morris and
                                                    produced by Steven Spielberg, premiered
                                                    in 1992. Hawking had wanted the film to be scientific rather than
                                                    biographical, but he was persuaded
                                                    otherwise. The film, while a critical success, was not widely
                                                    released. A popular-level collection
                                                    of essays, interviews, and talks titled Black Holes and Baby
                                                    Universes and Other Essays was published in
                                                    1993, and a six-part television series Stephen Hawking's Universe
                                                    and a companion book appeared in
                                                    1997. As Hawking insisted, this time the focus was entirely on
                                                    science.

                                                    Hawking continued his writings for a popular audience, publishing

                                                    2001, and A Briefer History of Time, which he wrote in 2005 with
                                                    Leonard Mlodinow to update his
                                                    earlier works with the aim of making them accessible to a wider
                                                    audience, and God Created the
                                                    Integers, which appeared in 2006. Along with Thomas Hertog at CERN
                                                    and Jim Hartle, from 2006 on
                                                    Hawking developed a theory of "top-down cosmology", which says that
                                                    the universe had not one unique
                                                    initial state but many different ones, and therefore that it is
                                                    inappropriate to formulate a theory
                                                    that predicts the universe's current configuration from one
                                                    particular initial state. Top-down
                                                    cosmology posits that the present "selects" the past from a
                                                    superposition of many possible histories.
                                                    In doing so, the theory suggests a possible resolution of the
                                                    fine-tuning question.

                                                    Hawking continued to travel widely, including trips to Chile, Easter

                                                    Hawking increasingly travelled by
                                                    private jet, and by 2011 that had become his only mode of
                                                    international travel.

                                                    By 2003, consensus among physicists was growing that Hawking was
                                                    wrong about the loss of information
                                                    in a black hole. In a 2004 lecture in Dublin, he conceded his 1997
                                                    bet with Preskill, but
                                                    described his own, somewhat controversial solution to the
                                                    information paradox problem, involving the
                                                    possibility that black holes have more than one topology. In the
                                                    2005 paper he published on
                                                    the subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained by
                                                    examining all the alternative
                                                    histories of universes, with the information loss in those with
                                                    black holes being cancelled out by
                                                    those without such loss. In January 2014, he called the alleged loss
                                                    of information in
                                                    black holes his "biggest blunder".

                                                    As part of another longstanding scientific dispute, Hawking had
                                                    emphatically argued, and bet, that
                                                    the Higgs boson would never be found. The particle was proposed
                                                    to exist as part of the Higgs
                                                    field theory by Peter Higgs in 1964. Hawking and Higgs engaged in a
                                                    heated and public debate over the
                                                    matter in 2002 and again in 2008, with Higgs criticising Hawking's
                                                    work and complaining that
                                                    Hawking's "celebrity status gives him instant credibility that
                                                    others do not have." The particle
                                                    was discovered in July 2012 at CERN following construction of the
                                                    Large Hadron Collider. Hawking
                                                    quickly conceded that he had lost his bet and said that Higgs should
                                                    win the Nobel Prize
                                                    for Physics, which he did in 2013.

                                                    In 2007, Hawking and his daughter Lucy published George's Secret Key

                                                    similar to those in the Hawking family. The book was followed by
                                                    sequels in 2009, 2011, 2014 and

                                                    One doctoral student did not

                                                    2009. Despite
                                                    suggestions that he might leave the United Kingdom as a protest

                                                    Hawking continued his writings for a popular audience, publishing
                                                    The Universe in a Nutshell in
                                                    2001, and A Briefer History of Time, which he wrote in 2005 with
                                                    Leonard Mlodinow to update his
                                                    earlier works with the aim of making them accessible to a wider
                                                    audience, and God Created the
                                                    Integers, which appeared in 2006. Along with Thomas Hertog at CERN
                                                    and Jim Hartle, from 2006 on
                                                    Hawking developed a theory of "top-down cosmology", which says that
                                                    the universe had not one unique
                                                    initial state but many different ones, and therefore that it is
                                                    inappropriate to formulate a theory
                                                    that predicts the universe's current configuration from one
                                                    particular initial state. Top-down
                                                    cosmology posits that the present "selects" the past from a
                                                    superposition of many possible
                                                    histories. In doing so, the theory suggests a possible resolution of
                                                    the fine-tuning
                                                    question.

                                                    Hawking continued to travel widely, including trips to Chile, Easter

                                                    the United

                                                    increasingly travelled by
                                                    private jet, and by 2011 that had become his only mode of
                                                    international travel.

                                                    By 2003, consensus among physicists was growing that Hawking was
                                                    wrong about the loss of information
                                                    in a black hole. In a 2004 lecture in Dublin, he conceded his 1997
                                                    bet with Preskill, but
                                                    described his own, somewhat controversial solution to the
                                                    information paradox problem, involving the
                                                    possibility that black holes have more than one topology. In the
                                                    2005 paper he published
                                                    on the subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained
                                                    by examining all the
                                                    alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in
                                                    those with black holes being
                                                    cancelled out by those without such loss. In January 2014, he called
                                                    the alleged loss of
                                                    information in black holes his "biggest blunder".

                                                    As part of another longstanding scientific dispute, Hawking had
                                                    emphatically argued, and bet, that
                                                    the Higgs boson would never be found. The particle was proposed to
                                                    exist as part of the Higgs
                                                    field theory by Peter Higgs in 1964. Hawking and Higgs engaged in a
                                                    heated and public debate over
                                                    the matter in 2002 and again in 2008, with Higgs criticising
                                                    Hawking's work and complaining that
                                                    Hawking's "celebrity status gives him instant credibility that
                                                    others do not have." The
                                                    particle was discovered in July 2012 at CERN following construction
                                                    of the Large Hadron Collider.
                                                    Hawking quickly conceded that he had lost his bet and said that
                                                    Higgs should win the Nobel
                                                    Prize for Physics, which he did in 2013.

                                                    similar to those in the Hawking family. The book was followed by
                                                    sequels in 2009, 2011, 2014

                                                    On 20 July 2015, Hawking helped launch Breakthrough Initiatives, an
                                                    effort to search for
                                                    extraterrestrial life. Hawking created Stephen Hawking: Expedition
                                                    New Earth, a documentary on
                                                    space colonisation, as a 2017 episode of Tomorrow's World.

                                                    In August 2015, Hawking said that not all information is lost when
                                                    something enters a black hole and
                                                    there might be a possibility to retrieve information from a black
                                                    hole according to his theory.
                                                    In July 2017, Hawking was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from
                                                    Imperial College London

                                                    Hawking's final paper – A smooth exit from eternal inflation? – was
                                                    posthumously published in the
                                                    Journal of High Energy Physics on 27 April 2018.

                                                    the age of 76.
                                                    His family stated that he "died peacefully". He was eulogised by
                                                    figures in science,
                                                    entertainment, politics, and other areas. The Gonville and Caius

                                                    Hawking was born on the 300th anniversary of Galileo's death and
                                                    died on the 139th anniversary of
                                                    Einstein's birth. His private funeral took place at 2 pm on the
                                                    afternoon of 31 March
                                                    2018, at Great St Mary's Church, Cambridge. Guests at the funeral
                                                    included The Theory

                                                    physicist Kip Thorne provided
                                                    readings at the service. Although Hawking was an atheist the funeral
                                                    took place with a

                                                    thanksgiving was held
                                                    at Westminster Abbey on 15 June 2018, after which his ashes were
                                                    interred in the Abbey's nave,

                                                    words to the world appeared
                                                    posthumously, in April 2018, in the form of a Smithsonian TV Channel

                                                    In 2006, Hawking posed an open question on the Internet: "In a world
                                                    that is in chaos politically,
                                                    socially and environmentally, how can the human race sustain another
                                                    100 years?", later clarifying:
                                                    "I don't know the answer. That is why I asked the question, to get
                                                    people to think about it, and to
                                                    be aware of the dangers we now face."

                                                    Hawking expressed concern that life on Earth is at risk from a
                                                    sudden nuclear war, a genetically
                                                    engineered virus, global warming, or other dangers humans have not
                                                    yet thought of. Hawking
                                                    stated: "I regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear
                                                    confrontation or environmental
                                                    catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000
                                                    years", and considered an
                                                    "asteroid collision" to be the biggest threat to the planet. Such a
                                                    planet-wide disaster need
                                                    not result in human extinction if the human race were to be able to
                                                    colonise additional planets
                                                    before the disaster. Hawking viewed spaceflight and the colonisation
                                                    of space as necessary for
                                                    the future of humanity.

                                                    Hawking stated that, given the vastness of the universe, aliens
                                                    likely exist, but that contact with
                                                    them should be avoided. He warned that aliens might pillage Earth
                                                    for resources. In 2010
                                                    he said, "If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when
                                                    Columbus landed in America, which
                                                    didn't turn out well for the Native Americans."

                                                    Hawking warned that superintelligent artificial intelligence could
                                                    be pivotal in steering humanity's
                                                    fate, stating that "the potential benefits are huge... Success in
                                                    creating AI would be the biggest
                                                    event in human history. It might also be the last, unless we learn
                                                    how to avoid the
                                                    risks."However, he argued that we should be more frightened of
                                                    capitalism exacerbating
                                                    economic inequality than robots.

                                                    Hawking was concerned about the future emergence of a race of
                                                    "superhumans" that would be able to
                                                    design their own evolution and, as well, argued that computer
                                                    viruses in today's world should
                                                    be considered a new form of life, stating that "maybe it says
                                                    something about human nature, that the
                                                    only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. Talk

                                                    "philosophy is dead". He believed that
                                                    philosophers "have not kept up with modern developments in science"
                                                    and that scientists "have become
                                                    the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge".
                                                    He said that philosophical
                                                    problems can be answered by science, particularly new scientific
                                                    theories which "lead us to a new

                                                    <blockquote>
                                                        Hawking has made major contributions to the field of general
                                                        relativity. These derive from a
                                                        deep understanding of what is relevant to physics and astronomy,
                                                        and especially from a mastery
                                                        of wholly new mathematical techniques. Following the pioneering
                                                        work of Penrose he established,
                                                        partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose, a series
                                                        of successively stronger
                                                        theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic
                                                        cosmological models must possess
                                                        singularities. Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the
                                                        basic theorems on the laws
                                                        governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's
                                                        equations with smooth event
                                                        horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the
                                                        evolution and interaction of black
                                                        holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must

                                                    Award in Basic Sciences shared with
                                                    Viatcheslav Mukhanov for discovering that the galaxies were formed

                                                    received the lifetime achievement award
                                                    "for his contribution to science and British culture". After
