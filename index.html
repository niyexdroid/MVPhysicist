                                    <p>Albert Einstein, (born March 14, 1879, Ulm, Württemberg, Germany—died April 18,
                                        1955, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.), German-born physicist who developed the
                                        special and general theories of relativity and won the Nobel
                                        Prize for Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.
                                        Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th

                                                <p>Einstein’s parents were secular, middle-class Jews. His father, Hermann Einstein, was originally a
                                                    featherbed salesman and later ran an electrochemical factory with moderate success. His mother, the
                                                    former
                                                    Pauline Koch, ran the family household. He had one sister, Maria (who went by the name Maja), born
                                                    two years after Albert.</p>

                                                <p>Einstein would write that two “wonders” deeply affected his early years. The first was his encounter
                                                    with a compass at age five. He was mystified that invisible forces could deflect the needle. This
                                                    would
                                                    lead to a lifelong fascination with invisible forces. The second wonder came at age 12 when he
                                                    discovered a book of geometry, which he devoured, calling it his “sacred little geometry book.”</p>

                                                <p>Einstein became deeply religious at age 12, even composing several songs in praise of God and
                                                    chanting religious songs on the way to school. This began to change, however, after he read science
                                                    books that
                                                    contradicted his religious beliefs. This challenge to established authority left a deep and lasting
                                                    impression. At the Luitpold Gymnasium, Einstein often felt out of place and victimized by a
                                                    Prussian-style
                                                    educational system that seemed to stifle originality and creativity. One teacher even told him that
                                                    he would never amount to anything.</p>
                                                <p>Yet another important influence on Einstein was a young medical student, Max Talmud (later Max
                                                    Talmey), who often had dinner at the Einstein home. Talmud became an informal tutor, introducing
                                                    Einstein to
                                                    higher mathematics and philosophy. A pivotal turning point occurred when Einstein was 16. Talmud had
                                                    earlier introduced him to a children’s science series by Aaron Bernstein, Naturwissenschaftliche
                                                    Volksbucher
                                                    (1867–68; Popular Books on Physical Science), in which the author imagined riding alongside
                                                    electricity that was traveling inside a telegraph wire. Einstein then asked himself the question
                                                    that would
                                                    dominate his thinking for the next 10 years: What would a light beam look like if you could run
                                                    alongside it? If light were a wave, then the light beam should appear stationary, like a frozen
                                                    wave. Even
                                                    as a child, though, he knew that stationary light waves had never been seen, so there was a paradox.
                                                    Einstein also wrote his first “scientific paper” at that time (“The Investigation of the State of
                                                    Aether in Magnetic Fields”).
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Einstein’s education was disrupted by his father’s repeated failures at business. In 1894, after his
                                                    company failed to get an important contract to electrify the city of Munich, Hermann Einstein moved
                                                    to
                                                    Milan to work with a relative. Einstein was left at a boardinghouse in Munich and expected to finish
                                                    his education. Alone, miserable, and repelled by the looming prospect of military duty when he
                                                    turned
                                                    16, Einstein ran away six months later and landed on the doorstep of his surprised parents. His
                                                    parents realized the enormous problems that he faced as a school dropout and draft dodger with no
                                                    employable
                                                    skills. His prospects did not look promising.</p>

                                                <p>Fortunately, Einstein could apply directly to the Eidgenössische Polytechnische Schule (“Swiss
                                                    Federal Polytechnic School”; in 1911, following expansion in 1909 to full university status, it was
                                                    renamed
                                                    the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, or “Swiss Federal Institute of Technology”) in Zürich

                                                    showed that he excelled in mathematics and physics, but he failed at French, chemistry, and biology.
                                                    Because of his exceptional math scores, he was allowed into the polytechnic on the condition that
                                                    he first finish his formal schooling. He went to a special high school run by Jost Winteler in
                                                    Aarau, Switzerland, and graduated in 1896. He also renounced his German citizenship at that time.
                                                    (He was
                                                    stateless until 1901, when he was granted Swiss citizenship.) He became lifelong friends with the
                                                    Winteler family, with whom he had been boarding. (Winteler’s daughter, Marie, was Einstein’s first
                                                    love;
                                                    Einstein’s sister, Maja, would eventually marry Winteler’s son Paul; and his close friend Michele
                                                    Besso would marry their eldest daughter, Anna.)</p>

                                                <p>Einstein would recall that his years in Zürich were some of the happiest years of his life. He met
                                                    many students who would become loyal friends, such as Marcel Grossmann, a mathematician, and Besso,
                                                    with
                                                    whom he enjoyed lengthy conversations about space and time. He also met his future wife, Mileva
                                                    Maric, a fellow physics student from Serbia.</p>

                                                <p>After graduation in 1900, Einstein faced one of the greatest crises in his life. Because he studied
                                                    advanced subjects on his own, he often cut classes; this earned him the animosity of some
                                                    professors, especially
                                                    Heinrich Weber. Unfortunately, Einstein asked Weber for a letter of recommendation. Einstein was
                                                    subsequently turned down for every academic position that he applied to.</p>
                                                <p>Meanwhile, Einstein’s relationship with Maric deepened, but his parents vehemently opposed the
                                                    relationship. His mother especially objected to her Serbian background (Maric’s family was Eastern
                                                    Orthodox
                                                    Christian). Einstein defied his parents, however, and in January 1902 he and Maric even had a child,
                                                    Lieserl, whose fate is unknown. (It is commonly thought that she died of scarlet fever or was given
                                                    up for adoption.)
                                                </p>

                                                <p>In 1902 Einstein reached perhaps the lowest point in his life. He could not marry Maric and support a
                                                    family without a job, and his father’s business went bankrupt. Desperate and unemployed, Einstein
                                                    took
                                                    lowly jobs tutoring children, but he was fired from even these jobs.</p>

                                                <p>The turning point came later that year, when the father of his lifelong friend Marcel Grossmann was
                                                    able to recommend him for a position as a clerk in the Swiss patent office in Bern. About then,
                                                    Einstein’s
                                                    father became seriously ill and, just before he died, gave his blessing for his son to marry Maric.
                                                    For years, Einstein would experience enormous sadness remembering that his father had died thinking
                                                    him a failure.</p>

                                                <p>With a small but steady income for the first time, Einstein felt confident enough to marry Maric,
                                                    which he did on January 6, 1903. Their children, Hans Albert and Eduard, were born in Bern in 1904
                                                    and 1910,
                                                    respectively. In hindsight, Einstein’s job at the patent office was a blessing. He would quickly
                                                    finish analyzing patent applications, leaving him time to daydream about the vision that had
                                                    obsessed
                                                    him since he was 16: What would happen if you raced alongside a light beam? While at the polytechnic
                                                    school he had studied Maxwell’s equations, which describe the nature of light, and discovered a fact
                                                    unknown to James Clerk Maxwell himself—namely, that the speed of light remains the same no matter
                                                    how fast one moves. This violates Newton’s laws of motion, however, because there is no absolute
                                                    velocity
                                                    in Isaac Newton’s theory. This insight led Einstein to formulate the principle of relativity: “the
                                                    speed of light is a constant in any inertial frame (constantly moving frame).”

                                                <p>During 1905, often called Einstein’s “miracle year,” he published four papers in the Annalen der
                                                    Physik, each of which would alter the course of modern physics:

                                                <p>Other scientists, especially Henri Poincaré and Hendrik Lorentz, had pieces of the theory of special
                                                    relativity, but Einstein was the first to assemble the whole theory together and to realize that it
                                                    was
                                                    a universal law of nature, not a curious figment of motion in the ether, as Poincaré and Lorentz had
                                                    thought. (In one private letter to Mileva, Einstein referred to “our theory,” which has led some to
                                                    speculate that she was a cofounder of relativity theory. However, Mileva had abandoned physics after
                                                    twice failing her graduate exams, and there is no record of her involvement in developing
                                                    relativity.
                                                    In fact, in his 1905 paper, Einstein only credits his conversations with Besso in developing
                                                    relativity.)

                                                    of light. Einstein was alone in realizing that they were in contradiction and that one of them must

                                                <p>At first Einstein’s 1905 papers were ignored by the physics community. This began to change after he
                                                    received the attention of just one physicist, perhaps the most influential physicist of his
                                                    generation,
                                                    Max Planck, the founder of the quantum theory.</p>
                                                <p>Soon, owing to Planck’s laudatory comments and to experiments that gradually confirmed his theories,
                                                    Einstein was invited to lecture at international meetings, such as the Solvay Conferences, and he
                                                    rose
                                                    rapidly in the academic world. He was offered a series of positions at increasingly prestigious
                                                    institutions, including the University of Zürich, the University of Prague, the Swiss Federal
                                                    Institute
                                                    of Technology, and finally the University of Berlin, where he served as director of the Kaiser
                                                    Wilhelm Institute for Physics from 1913 to 1933 (although the opening of the institute was delayed
                                                    until
                                                    1917).

                                                <p>Even as his fame spread, Einstein’s marriage was falling apart. He was constantly on the road,
                                                    speaking at international conferences, and lost in contemplation of relativity. The couple argued
                                                    frequently
                                                    about their children and their meager finances. Convinced that his marriage was doomed, Einstein
                                                    began an affair with a cousin, Elsa Löwenthal, whom he later married. (Elsa was a first cousin on
                                                    his
                                                    mother’s side and a second cousin on his father’s side.) When he finally divorced Mileva in 1919, he
                                                    agreed to give her the money he might receive if he ever won a Nobel Prize.</p>

                                                <p>One of the deep thoughts that consumed Einstein from 1905 to 1915 was a crucial flaw in his own
                                                    theory: it made no mention of gravitation or acceleration. His friend Paul Ehrenfest had noticed a
                                                    curious
                                                    fact. If a disk is spinning, its rim travels faster than its centre, and hence (by special
                                                    relativity) metre sticks placed on its circumference should shrink. This meant that Euclidean plane
                                                    geometry
                                                    must fail for the disk. For the next 10 years, Einstein would be absorbed with formulating a theory
                                                    of gravity in terms of the curvature of space-time. To Einstein, Newton’s gravitational force was
                                                    actually
                                                    a by-product of a deeper reality: the bending of the fabric of space and time.</p>

                                                <p>In November 1915 Einstein finally completed the general theory of relativity, which he considered to
                                                    be his masterpiece. In the summer of 1915, Einstein had given six two-hour lectures at the
                                                    University
                                                    of Göttingen that thoroughly explained an incomplete version of general relativity that lacked a few
                                                    necessary mathematical details. Much to Einstein’s consternation, the mathematician David Hilbert,
                                                    who had organized the lectures at his university and had been corresponding with Einstein, then
                                                    completed these details and submitted a paper in November on general relativity just five days
                                                    before Einstein,
                                                    as if the theory were his own. Later they patched up their differences and remained friends.
                                                    Einstein would write to Hilbert,
                                                    <blockquote><em><q>I struggled against a resulting sense of bitterness,
                                                                and I did so with complete success. I once more think of you
                                                                in unclouded friendship, and would ask you to try to do
                                                                likewise toward me.</q></em></blockquote>
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Today physicists refer to the action from which the equations are derived as the Einstein-Hilbert
                                                    action, but the theory itself is attributed solely to Einstein.</p>

                                                <p>Einstein was convinced that general relativity was correct because of its mathematical beauty and
                                                    because it accurately predicted the precession of the perihelion of Mercury’s orbit around the Sun
                                                    (see Mercury:
                                                    Mercury in tests of relativity). His theory also predicted a measurable deflection of light around
                                                    the Sun. As a consequence, he even offered to help fund an expedition to measure the deflection of
                                                    starlight
                                                    during an eclipse of the Sun.</p>

                                                <p>Einstein’s work was interrupted by World War I. A lifelong pacifist, he was only one of four
                                                    intellectuals in Germany to sign a manifesto opposing Germany’s entry into war. Disgusted, he called
                                                    nationalism
                                                    “the measles of mankind.” He would write, “At such a time as this, one realizes what a sorry species
                                                    of animal one belongs to.” </p>
                                                <p>In the chaos unleashed after the war, in November 1918, radical students seized control of the
                                                    University of Berlin and held the rector of the college and several professors hostage. Many feared
                                                    that calling
                                                    in the police to release the officials would result in a tragic confrontation. Einstein, because he
                                                    was respected by both students and faculty, was the logical candidate to mediate this crisis.
                                                    Together
                                                    with Max Born, Einstein brokered a compromise that resolved it. </p>
                                                <p>After the war, two expeditions were sent to test Einstein’s prediction of deflected starlight near
                                                    the Sun. One set sail for the island of Principe, off the coast of West Africa, and the other to

                                                    were announced in London at a joint meeting of the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society.

                                                <p>The headline of The Times of London read, “Revolution in Science—New Theory of the Universe—Newton’s

                                                    world-renowned
                                                    physicist, the successor to Isaac Newton.</p>

                                                <p>Invitations came pouring in for him to speak around the world. In 1921 Einstein began the first of
                                                    several world tours, visiting the United States, England, Japan, and France. Everywhere he went, the
                                                    crowds
                                                    numbered in the thousands. En route from Japan, he received word that he had received the Nobel
                                                    Prize for Physics, but for the photoelectric effect rather than for his relativity theories. During

                                                    acceptance speech, Einstein startled the audience by speaking about relativity instead of the
                                                    photoelectric effect.</p>
                                                <p>Einstein also launched the new science of cosmology. His equations predicted that the universe is
                                                    dynamic—expanding or contracting. This contradicted the prevailing view that the universe was
                                                    static, so
                                                    he reluctantly introduced a “cosmological term” to stabilize his model of the universe. In 1929
                                                    astronomer Edwin Hubble found that the universe was indeed expanding, thereby confirming Einstein’s
                                                    earlier
                                                    work. In 1930, in a visit to the Mount Wilson Observatory near Los Angeles, Einstein met with Hubble
                                                    and declared the cosmological constant to be his “greatest blunder.” Recent satellite data, however,
                                                    have shown that the cosmological constant is probably not zero but actually dominates the
                                                    matter-energy content of the entire universe. Einstein’s “blunder” apparently determines the
                                                    ultimate fate of
                                                    the universe.</p>

                                                <p>During that same visit to California, Einstein was asked to appear alongside the comic actor Charlie
                                                    Chaplin during the Hollywood debut of the film City Lights. When they were mobbed by thousands,
                                                    Chaplin
                                                    remarked, “The people applaud me because everybody understands me, and they applaud you because no
                                                    one understands you.” Einstein asked Chaplin, “What does it all mean?” Chaplin replied, “Nothing.”
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Einstein also began correspondences with other influential thinkers during this period. He
                                                    corresponded with Sigmund Freud (both of them had sons with mental problems) on whether war was
                                                    intrinsic to humanity.
                                                    He discussed with the Indian mystic Rabindranath Tagore the question of whether consciousness can
                                                    affect existence. One journalist remarked,</p>

                                                    <blockquote><em>It was interesting to see them together—Tagore, the poet with the head of a thinker,
                                                            and Einstein, the thinker with the head of a poet. It seemed to an observer as though two
                                                            planets were engaged in a chat.</em></blockquote>

                                                <p>Einstein also clarified his religious views, stating that he believed there was an “old one” who was
                                                    the ultimate lawgiver. He wrote that he did not believe in a personal God that intervened in human
                                                    affairs
                                                    but instead believed in the God of the 17th-century Dutch Jewish philosopher Benedict de Spinoza—the
                                                    God of harmony and beauty. His task, he believed, was to formulate a master theory that would allow
                                                    him to “read the mind of God.” He would write,</p>

                                                <p>Inevitably, Einstein’s fame and the great success of his theories created a backlash. The rising Nazi
                                                    movement found a convenient target in relativity, branding it “Jewish physics” and sponsoring
                                                    conferences
                                                    and book burnings to denounce Einstein and his theories. The Nazis enlisted other physicists,
                                                    including Nobel laureates Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark, to denounce Einstein. One Hundred

                                                    Einstein was published in 1931. When asked to comment on this denunciation of relativity by so many
                                                    scientists, Einstein replied that to defeat relativity one did not need the word of 100 scientists,
                                                    just one fact.</p>

                                                <p>In December 1932 Einstein decided to leave Germany forever (he would never go back). It became
                                                    obvious to Einstein that his life was in danger. A Nazi organization published a magazine with
                                                    Einstein’s picture
                                                    and the caption “Not Yet Hanged” on the cover. There was even a price on his head. So great was the
                                                    threat that Einstein split with his pacifist friends and said that it was justified to defend
                                                    yourself
                                                    with arms against Nazi aggression. To Einstein, pacifism was not an absolute concept but one that
                                                    had to be re-examined depending on the magnitude of the threat.</p>

                                                <p>Einstein settled at the newly formed Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, New Jersey, which
                                                    soon became a mecca for physicists from around the world. Newspaper articles declared that the “pope
                                                    of physics”
                                                    had left Germany and that Princeton had become the new Vatican.</p>

                                                <p>The 1930s were hard years for Einstein. His son Eduard was diagnosed with schizophrenia and suffered
                                                    a mental breakdown in 1930. (Eduard would be institutionalized for the rest of his life.) Einstein’s

                                                    friend, physicist Paul Ehrenfest, who helped in the development of general relativity, committed
                                                    suicide in 1933. And Einstein’s beloved wife, Elsa, died in 1936.</p>
                                                <p>To his horror, during the late 1930s, physicists began seriously to consider whether his equation E =
                                                    mc2 might make an atomic bomb possible. In 1920 Einstein himself had considered but eventually
                                                    dismissed
                                                    the possibility. However, he left it open if a method could be found to magnify the power of the
                                                    atom. Then in 1938–39 Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassmann, Lise Meitner, and Otto Frisch showed that vast
                                                    amounts
                                                    of energy could be unleashed by the splitting of the uranium atom. The news electrified the physics
                                                    community.</p>

                                                <p>In July 1939 physicist Leo Szilard convinced Einstein that he should send a letter to U.S. President
                                                    Franklin D. Roosevelt urging him to develop an atomic bomb. With Einstein’s guidance, Szilard
                                                    drafted
                                                    a letter on August 2 that Einstein signed, and the document was delivered to Roosevelt by one of his
                                                    economic advisers, Alexander Sachs, on October 11. Roosevelt wrote back on October 19, informing
                                                    Einstein
                                                    that he had organized the Uranium Committee to study the issue.</p>

                                                <p>Einstein was granted permanent residency in the United States in 1935 and became an American citizen
                                                    in 1940, although he chose to retain his Swiss citizenship. During the war Einstein’s colleagues
                                                    were
                                                    asked to journey to the desert town of Los Alamos, New Mexico, to develop the first atomic bomb for
                                                    the Manhattan Project. Einstein, the man whose equation had set the whole effort into motion, was
                                                    never
                                                    asked to participate. Voluminous declassified Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) files, numbering
                                                    several thousand, reveal the reason: the U.S. government feared Einstein’s lifelong association with
                                                    peace and socialist organizations. (FBI director J. Edgar Hoover went so far as to recommend that
                                                    Einstein be kept out of America by the Alien Exclusion Act, but he was overruled by the U.S. State
                                                    Department.)
                                                    Instead, during the war Einstein was asked to help the U.S. Navy evaluate designs for future weapons
                                                    systems. Einstein also helped the war effort by auctioning off priceless personal manuscripts. In
                                                    particular, a handwritten copy of his 1905 paper on special relativity was sold for $6.5 million. It
                                                    is now located in the Library of Congress.</p>

                                                <p>Einstein was on vacation when he heard the news that an atomic bomb had been dropped on Japan. Almost
                                                    immediately he was part of an international effort to try to bring the atomic bomb under control,
                                                    forming
                                                    the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists.</p>

                                                <p>The physics community split on the question of whether to build a hydrogen bomb. J. Robert
                                                    Oppenheimer, the director of the atomic bomb project, was stripped of his security clearance for
                                                    having suspected
                                                    leftist associations. Einstein backed Oppenheimer and opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb,
                                                    instead calling for international controls on the spread of nuclear technology. Einstein also was
                                                    increasingly
                                                    drawn to antiwar activities and to advancing the civil rights of African Americans.</p>

                                                <p>In 1952 David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s premier, offered Einstein the post of president of Israel.
                                                    Einstein, a prominent figure in the Zionist movement, respectfully declined.</p>

                                                <p>Although Einstein continued to pioneer many key developments in the theory of general relativity—such
                                                    as wormholes, higher dimensions, the possibility of time travel, the existence of black holes, and

                                                    creation of the universe—he was increasingly isolated from the rest of the physics community.
                                                    Because of the huge strides made by quantum theory in unraveling the secrets of atoms and molecules,
                                                    the
                                                    majority of physicists were working on the quantum theory, not relativity. In fact, Einstein would
                                                    engage in a series of historic private debates with Niels Bohr, originator of the Bohr atomic model.
                                                    Through a series of sophisticated “thought experiments,” Einstein tried to find logical
                                                    inconsistencies in the quantum theory, particularly its lack of a deterministic mechanism. Einstein
                                                    would often
                                                    say that “God does not play dice with the universe.”</p>

                                                <p>In 1935 Einstein’s most celebrated attack on the quantum theory led to the EPR
                                                    (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) thought experiment. According to quantum theory, under certain
                                                    circumstances two electrons separated
                                                    by huge distances would have their properties linked, as if by an umbilical cord. Under these
                                                    circumstances, if the properties of the first electron were measured, the state of the second
                                                    electron would
                                                    be known instantly—faster than the speed of light. This conclusion, Einstein claimed, clearly
                                                    violated relativity. (Experiments conducted since then have confirmed that the quantum theory,
                                                    rather than
                                                    Einstein, was correct about the EPR experiment. In essence, what Einstein had actually shown was
                                                    that quantum mechanics is nonlocal; i.e., random information can travel faster than light. This does
                                                    not
                                                    violate relativity, because the information is random and therefore useless.)</p>

                                                <p>The other reason for Einstein’s increasing detachment from his colleagues was his obsession,
                                                    beginning in 1925, with discovering a unified field theory—an all-embracing theory that would unify
                                                    the forces
                                                    of the universe, and thereby the laws of physics, into one framework. In his later years he stopped
                                                    opposing the quantum theory and tried to incorporate it, along with light and gravity, into a larger
                                                    unified field theory. Gradually Einstein became set in his ways. He rarely traveled far and confined
                                                    himself to long walks around Princeton with close associates, whom he engaged in deep conversations
                                                    about politics, religion, physics, and his unified field theory. In 1950 he published an article on
                                                    his theory in Scientific American, but because it neglected the still-mysterious strong force, it
                                                    was
                                                    necessarily incomplete. When he died five years later of an aortic aneurysm, it was still
                                                    unfinished.</p>

                                                    strong force, a major piece of any unified field theory, was still a total mystery in Einstein’s
                                                    lifetime.
                                                    Only in the 1970s and ’80s did physicists begin to unravel the secret of the strong force with the
                                                    quark model. Nevertheless, Einstein’s work continues to win Nobel Prizes for succeeding physicists.
                                                    In 1993 a Nobel Prize was awarded to the discoverers of gravitation waves, predicted by Einstein. In
                                                    1995 a Nobel Prize was awarded to the discoverers of Bose-Einstein condensates (a new form of matter
                                                    that can occur at extremely low temperatures). Known black holes now number in the thousands. New
                                                    generations of space satellites have continued to verify the cosmology of Einstein. And many leading
                                                    physicists are trying to finish Einstein’s ultimate dream of a “theory of everything.”</p>

                                                <p> <strong>Early Years</strong> </p> 
                                                <p> Schrödinger was born in Erdberg [de], Vienna, Austria, on 12 August 1887, to Rudolf Schrödinger [de]
                                                (cerecloth producer, botanist) and Georgine Emilia Brenda Schrödinger (née Bauer) (daughter of
                                                Alexander Bauer [de],professor of chemistry, TU Wien). He was their only child.</p>
                                                <p>His mother was of half Austrian and half English descent; his father was Catholic and his mother was
                                                Lutheran. Although he was raised in a religious household as a Lutheran, he himself was an atheist.
                                                However, he had strong interests in Eastern religions and pantheism, and he used religious symbolism in
                                                his works. He also believed his scientific work was an approach to the godhead, albeit in a
                                                intellectual sense.</p> 
                                                <p>He was also able to learn English outside school, as his maternal grandmother was British. Between
                                                1906 and 1910 Schrödinger studied in Vienna under Franz S. Exner (1849–1926) and Friedrich Hasenöhrl
                                                (1874–1915). He also conducted experimental work with Karl Wilhelm Friedrich "Fritz" Kohlrausch.</p>
                                                <p>In 1911, Schrödinger became an assistant to Exner. At an early age, Schrödinger was strongly influenced
                                                by Arthur Schopenhauer. As a result of his extensive reading of Schopenhauer's works, he became deeply
                                                interested throughout his life in colour theory and philosophy. In his lecture "Mind and Matter", he
                                                said that "The world extended in space and time is but our representation." This is a repetition of the
                                                first words of Schopenhauer's main work.</p>

                                                <p> <strong>Middle Years</strong> </p>
                                                <p>Erwin Schrödinger as a young man
                                                In 1914 Erwin Schrödinger achieved Habilitation (venia legendi). Between 1914 and 1918 he participated
                                                in war work as a commissioned officer in the Austrian fortress artillery (Gorizia, Duino, Sistiana,
                                                Prosecco, Vienna). In 1920 he became the assistant to Max Wien, in Jena, and in September 1920 he
                                                attained the position of ao. Prof. (ausserordentlicher Professor), roughly equivalent to Reader (UK) or
                                                associate professor (US), in Stuttgart. In 1921, he became o. Prof. (ordentlicher Professor, i.e. full
                                                professor), in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland).</p>
                                                <p>In 1921, he moved to the University of Zürich. In 1927, he succeeded Max Planck at the Friedrich Wilhelm
                                                University in Berlin. In 1933, Schrödinger decided to leave Germany; he disliked the Nazis'
                                                antisemitism. He became a Fellow of Magdalen College at the University of Oxford. Soon after he arrived,
                                                he received the Nobel Prize together with Paul Dirac. His position at Oxford did not work out well; his
                                                unconventional domestic arrangements, sharing living quarters with two women, were not met with
                                                acceptance. In 1934, Schrödinger lectured at Princeton University; he was offered a permanent position
                                                there, but did not accept it. Again, his wish to set up house with his wife and his mistress may have
                                                created a problem. He had the prospect of a position at the University of Edinburgh but visa delays
                                                occurred, and in the end he took up a position at the University of Graz in Austria in 1936. He had also
                                                accepted the offer of chair position at Department of Physics, Allahabad University in India.</p>
                                                <p>In the midst of these tenure issues in 1935, after extensive correspondence with Albert Einstein, he
                                                proposed what is now called the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.</p>

                                                <p> <strong>Later Years</strong> </p>
                                                <p>In 1938, after the Anschluss, Schrödinger had problems because of his flight from Germany in 1933 and
                                                his known opposition to Nazism. He issued a statement recanting this opposition (he later regretted
                                                doing so and explained the reason to Einstein). However, this did not fully appease the new
                                                dispensation and the University of Graz dismissed him from his job for political unreliability. He
                                                suffered harassment and received instructions not to leave the country, but he and his wife fled to
                                                Italy. From there, he went to visiting positions in Oxford and Ghent University.</p>
                                                <p>In the same year he received a personal invitation from Ireland's Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera – a
                                                mathematician himself – to reside in Ireland and agree to help establish an Institute for Advanced
                                                Studies in Dublin. He moved to Clontarf, Dublin, became the Director of the School for Theoretical
                                                Physics in 1940 and remained there for 17 years. He became a naturalized Irish citizen in 1948, but
                                                retained his Austrian citizenship[citation needed]. He wrote around 50 further publications on various
                                                topics, including his explorations of unified field theory.</p>
                                                <p>In 1944, he wrote What Is Life?, which contains a discussion of negentropy and the concept of a complex
                                                molecule with the genetic code for living organisms. According to James D. Watson's memoir, DNA, the
                                                Secret of Life, Schrödinger's book gave Watson the inspiration to research the gene, which led to the
                                                discovery of the DNA double helix structure in 1953. Similarly, Francis Crick, in his autobiographical
                                                book What Mad Pursuit, described how he was influenced by Schrödinger's speculations about how genetic
                                                information might be stored in molecules.</p>
                                                <p>Schrödinger stayed in Dublin until retiring in 1955. He had a lifelong interest in the Vedanta
                                                philosophy of Hinduism, which influenced his speculations at the close of What Is Life? about the
                                                possibility that individual consciousness is only a manifestation of a unitary consciousness pervading
                                                the universe. A manuscript "Fragment from an unpublished dialogue of Galileo" from this time
                                                recently resurfaced at The King's Hospital boarding school, Dublin[24] after it was written for the
                                                School's 1955 edition of their Blue Coat to celebrate his leaving of Dublin to take up his appointment
                                                as Chair of Physics at the University of Vienna.</p>
                                                <p>In 1956, he returned to Vienna (chair ad personam). At an important lecture during the World Energy
                                                Conference he refused to speak on nuclear energy because of his skepticism about it and gave a
                                                philosophical lecture instead. During this period Schrödinger turned from mainstream quantum mechanics'
                                                definition of wave–particle duality and promoted the wave idea alone,[citation needed] causing much
                                                controversy.</p>

                                                <p> <strong>Personal Life</strong> </p>
                                                <p>On 6 April 1920, Schrödinger married Annemarie (Anny) Bertel. Schrödinger suffered from tuberculosis
                                                and several times in the 1920s stayed at a sanatorium in Arosa. It was there that he formulated his wave equation. As has been noted above, Schrödinger had an unconventional personal life. When he migrated
                                                to Ireland in 1938, he obtained visas for himself, his wife and also another woman, Mrs. Hilde March.
                                                March was the wife of an Austrian colleague and Schrödinger had fathered a daughter with her in
                                                1934. Schrödinger wrote personally to the Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, to obtain the visa for Mrs.
                                                March. In October 1939 the ménage à trois duly took up residence in Dublin. Schrödinger fathered two further daughters by two different women during his time in Ireland.</p>
                                                <p>On 4 January 1961, Schrödinger died of tuberculosis, aged 73, in Vienna.[1] He left Anny a widow, and
                                                was buried in Alpbach, Austria, in a Catholic cemetery. Although he was not Catholic, the priest in
                                                charge of the cemetery permitted the burial after learning Schrödinger was a member of the Pontifical
                                                Academy of Sciences. His wife, Anny (born 3 December 1896) died on 3 October 1965. Schrödinger's
                                                grandson, Professor Terry Rudolph, has followed in his footsteps as a quantum physicist, and teaches at
                                                Imperial College London.</p>

                                                <p> <strong>Early Career</strong> </p>
                                                <p>Early in his life, Schrödinger experimented in the fields of electrical engineering, atmospheric
                                                    electricity, and atmospheric radioactivity, but he usually worked with his former teacher Franz
                                                    Exner. He also studied vibrational theory, the theory of Brownian movement, and mathematical
                                                    statistics. In 1912, at the request of the editors of the Handbook of Electricity and Magnetism,
                                                    Schrödinger wrote an article titled Dieelectrism. That same year, Schrödinger gave a theoretical
                                                    estimate of the probable height distribution of radioactive substances, which is required to explain
                                                    the observed radioactivity of the atmosphere, and in August 1913 executed several experiments in
                                                    Zeehame that confirmed his theoretical estimate and those of Victor Franz Hess. For this work,
                                                    Schrödinger was awarded the 1920 Haitinger Prize (Haitinger-Preis) of the Austrian Academy of
                                                    Sciences. Other experimental studies conducted by the young researcher in 1914 were checking
                                                    formulas for capillary pressure in gas bubbles and the study of the properties of soft
                                                    beta-radiation appearing in the fall of gamma rays on the surface of metal. The last work he
                                                    performed together with his friend Fritz Kohlrausch. In 1919, Schrödinger performed his last
                                                    physical experiment on coherent light and subsequently focused on theoretical studies.</p>

                                                <p> <strong>Quantum Mechanics</strong> </p>
                                                <p><em>New Quantum Theory</em></p>
                                                <p>In the first years of his career Schrödinger became acquainted with the ideas of quantum theory,
                                                    developed in the works of Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Arnold Sommerfeld, and others.
                                                    This knowledge helped him work on some problems in theoretical physics, but the Austrian scientist
                                                    at the time was not yet ready to part with the traditional methods of classical physics.</p>
                                                <p>The first publications of Schrödinger about atomic theory and the theory of spectra began to emerge
                                                    only from the beginning of the 1920s, after his personal acquaintance with Sommerfeld and Wolfgang
                                                    Pauli and his move to Germany. In January 1921, Schrödinger finished his first article on this
                                                    subject, about the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld effect of the interaction of electrons on some
                                                    features of the spectra of the alkali metals. Of particular interest to him was the introduction of
                                                    relativistic considerations in quantum theory. In autumn 1922 he analyzed the electron orbits in an
                                                    atom from a geometric point of view, using methods developed by the mathematician Hermann Weyl
                                                    (1885–1955). This work, in which it was shown that quantum orbits are associated with certain
                                                    geometric properties, was an important step in predicting some of the features of wave mechanics.
                                                    Earlier in the same year he created the Schrödinger equation of the relativistic Doppler effect for
                                                    spectral lines, based on the hypothesis of light quanta and considerations of energy and momentum.
                                                    He liked the idea of his teacher Exner on the statistical nature of the conservation laws, so he
                                                    enthusiastically embraced the articles of Bohr, Kramers, and Slater, which suggested the possibility
                                                    of violation of these laws in individual atomic processes (for example, in the process of emission
                                                    of radiation). Although the experiments of Hans Geiger and Walther Bothe soon cast doubt on this,
                                                    the idea of energy as a statistical concept was a lifelong attraction for Schrödinger and he
                                                    discussed it in some reports and publications.</p>

                                                <p> <strong>Creation of Wave Mechanics</strong> </p>
                                                <p>In January of 1926, Schrödinger published in Annalen der Physik the paper "Quantisierung als
                                                    Eigenwertproblem" (Quantization as an Eigenvalue Problem) on wave mechanics and presented what is
                                                    now known as the Schrödinger equation. In this paper, he gave a "derivation" of the wave equation
                                                    for time-independent systems and showed that it gave the correct energy eigenvalues for a
                                                    hydrogen-like atom. This paper has been universally celebrated as one of the most important
                                                    achievements of the twentieth century and created a revolution in most areas of quantum mechanics
                                                    and indeed of all physics and chemistry. A second paper was submitted just four weeks later that
                                                    solved the quantum harmonic oscillator, rigid rotor, and diatomic molecule problems and gave a new
                                                    derivation of the Schrödinger equation. A third paper, published in May, showed the equivalence of
                                                    his approach to that of Heisenberg and gave the treatment of the Stark effect. A fourth paper in
                                                    this series showed how to treat problems in which the system changes with time, as in scattering
                                                    problems. In this paper he introduced a complex solution to the Wave equation in order to prevent
                                                    the occurrence of fourth and sixth order differential equations. (This was arguably the moment when
                                                    quantum mechanics switched from real to complex numbers.) When he introduced complex numbers in
                                                    order to lower the order of the differential equations, something magical happened, and all of wave
                                                    mechanics was at his feet. (He eventually reduced the order to one.) These papers were his central
                                                    achievement and were at once recognized as having great significance by the physics community.</p>

                                                <p>Schrödinger was not entirely comfortable with the implications of quantum theory. He wrote about the
                                                    probability interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying: "I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had
                                                    anything to do with it." (Just in order to ridicule the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
                                                    mechanics he contrived the famous thought-experiment called Schrödinger's cat paradox.)</p>


                                                <p> <strong>Work on a Unified Field Theory</strong> </p>
                                                Following his work on quantum mechanics, Schrödinger devoted considerable effort to working on a unified
                                                field theory that would unite gravity, electromagnetism, and nuclear forces within the basic framework
                                                of General Relativity, doing the work with an extended correspondence with Albert Einstein.[ In 1947, he
                                                announced a result, "Affine Field Theory," in a talk at the Royal Irish Academy, but the announcement
                                                was criticized by Einstein as "preliminary" and failed to lead to the desired unified theory. Following
                                                the failure of his attempt at unification, Schrödinger gave up his work on unification and turned to
                                                other topics.</p>

                                                <p>Schrödinger had a strong interest in psychology, in particular colour perception and colorimetry
                                                    (German: Farbenmetrik). He spent quite a few years of his life working on these questions and
